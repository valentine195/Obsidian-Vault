## Whitecliff

Founded 4 years ago by Cyran refugees fleeing the Mourning, Whitecliff is a small mining town located on the very edge of the Q'Barran jungle. The town sits at the base of a bone-white cliff that many locals believe is actually the tip of a vertebrae of Eberron, rising up one hundred feet at its highest point. Whitecliff has seen an influx of settlers in recent months when a large deposit of high quality Eberron dragonshards was discovered nearby. This newfound wealth has drawn the eyes of House Tharashk, who have set up an outpost in the town.
