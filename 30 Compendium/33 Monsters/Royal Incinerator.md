traits:
- [Battle Scars,  If the royal incinerator is killed by a creature before finishing its mission, when the royal incinerator comes back to life, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, saving throws, and attack and damage rolls. This effect stacks with each death until the mission is completed.]
- [Blaze of Glory,  The royal incinerator lights ablaze as a bonus action, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. Their weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage (included in the stat block). This effect lasts until the royal incinerator dies or extinguishes itself as a bonus action.]
- [Faultless Tracker,  The royal incinerator has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track humanoids, and damage it deals to them ignores resistances.]
- [Fire Absorption,  Whenever the royal incinerator is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.]
- [Magic Resistance, The royal incinerator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.]
- [Magic Weapons, The royal incinerator's weapon attacks are magical.]
- [Unfaltering, The royal incinerator is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form and it isnâ€™t affected by spells of the enchantment or illusion schools of magic.]
- [Rejuvenation, As long as its brazier is lit, a destroyed royal incinerator gains a new body in 1 week, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the brazier.]

- [Impale, "Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the blade and take 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of their turns. The royal incinerator can then only use slam attacks, until it summons its sword back to it as a bonus action, freeing the target. The target, or an ally of them, can use their action to remove the blade, freeing themselves."]
