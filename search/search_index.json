They, along with Conk the goblin, left town with Quinn, the wagon driver. On the road they met Jasper Bartlett, who asked Quinn why he was working with the very people they used to fight. The trip was uneventful on the first day, where they were able to just get to know each other. But on the second day, Quinn pulled off the side of the road and met with a half orc and two humans, who informed the group that they were robbing them of the dragon shards in an insurance scam. They told the group that if they helped them unload the cargo then no one would need to get hurt, so the group (very untrustfully) followed them to the cave. Once in the cave, the group helped unload the dragon shards into a bag of holding, but were betrayed once the shards were all loaded. They successfully subdued the attackers, and Nia executed the last remaining bandit who was begging for mercy. Jasper Bartlett brought Quinn back into the cave, and Jeremiah found a fancy light up shield engraved with a silver flame. Jasper told the group he wanted to talk to the mayor to run Tharashk out of town. They headed back and began speaking to the mayor, but the mayor was poisoned by a cup of coffee. Ven Leser burst into the room and accused the group of murdering the mayor. He had several of his guards arrest the group, but before they were able to subdue them, Mim (as Nia), was able to escape out the window, invisible. In jail, they met a man named Pust, who gave them a large golden coin in exchange for freeing him. She followed them up to the jail cell and changed into a guard, and was able to successfully convince the other guards that she was sent to help \u2013 while they were distracted with cards, she picked the locks of the cells. Pust shadow stepped away from the jail, and then the group successfully killed the guards and reclaimed their weapons.","title":"2021 01 02"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-01-16/","tags":["session/recap","session/2"],"text":"The group started in the jail. Mim took some fancy weighted dice, but noticed that Jasper was staring at her. He confronted her for being a changeling, but the situation was defused when Conk barged into the room, sword waving, trying to save the group. Conk explained that the town was under siege by the bandits, and they had rounded up several townspeople and taken them to the manor. Several other townspeople were barricaded into the Pub. Jasper told the group to save the people in the pub while he scouted out the manor. They snuck to the Pub and confronted the bandits in front, successfully saving the townsfolk inside. Jeremiah\u2019s shield flared with light when he killed a bandit that was about to kill a townsperson. The owner of the pub, Jim, said that a bunch of people were taken to the manor. The group went to the manor and successfully snuck in, then saved the townspeople on the first floor. They went upstairs and found the room of Luca Strongrage, where Mim found the stuffed rabbit, Bun-Bun. They then listened at the door to the master and heard Percy, Ven Leser\u2019s butler, tell someone to move their plans up at the mine because Quinn\u2019s plan had failed. They entered the room to find Conk and Jasper tied to chairs in the middle of the room, Percy standing at a window, and Ven Leser tied up upstairs. The group attacked and Percy quickly fled. They untied Ven Leser and fought the minotaur, but Bob and Mim went down and Ven Leser died before they were able to kill the minotaur.","title":"2021 01 16"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-02-06/","tags":["session/recap","session/3"],"text":"The group long rested and nursed Jasper and Conk back to health. Jasper told them that he heard Percy talking about hearing information from Heather, the mayor\u2019s assistant. They went looking for her and found her in the Mayor\u2019s office, rifling through the bookcases, muttering \u201cI know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d Jeremiah confronted her and she said she was just trying to help Percy out because he said she\u2019d be admitted into the house, she never wanted to kill the mayor. Jeremiah destroyed the desk to intimidate her, which exposed a drawer with a hidden desk. Then Heather cast charm person on Mim and Jeremiah while Bob was outside with Ghouly, but when he realized something odd was going on he went inside and grabbed the drawer before Heather could get it. She swung her sword at him in anger, and then Mim countered the charm with Bun-Bun. They eventually killed her, but not before she kept saying that the Lady of Death was going to kill them all anyway and her death was just a release back to the Lady. After finding the map in the drawer, they spent their day about town. Jeremiah and Mim won some gold playing dice while Bob spent the day making a potion of health. An airship landed in town with a reporter from the Newthrone Gazette, who wanted to interview who he was calling the \u201cHeroes of Whitecliff\u201d. The next day, Conk returned with a miner, who told them the Land Sharks had overrun the mine. They traveled to the mine as quickly as they could, but had to make camp. Mim learned that Jasper knows the leader of the Gray Tide, a changeling named Kel. Bob learned that his workshop appeared outside of town the day of the Mourning, and looks exactly like other Cannith architecture Jasper has seen. Jeremiah learned his shield is from a Templar of the Silver Flame. They made it to the mine, where Mim released a captured Bulette which caused havoc in the camp. The rest of the group snuck in and made it to the elevator of the cave, where they defeated a bandit captain to gain possession of the ring of air elemental command, then entered the elevator and began to descend to the mine.","title":"2021 02 06"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-02-20/","tags":["session/recap","session/4"],"text":"The elevator lurched to a stop at the Heroes of Whitecliff stepped into the mine. While they were taking in their surroundings, a loud ka-BOOM echoed through the mine, shaking the room they were in. Investigating further into the mine, they found a small barracks filled with bound miners, and they could hear two bandits talking about some creepy elf girl that came down to the mine with Quinn. After freeing the miners, the group told them to barricade themselves inside the room. The miners offered to let them rest there if they ever required it. The group continued through the mine. They found a room with several goblin statues, where they found small stones that allowed them to telepathically communicate with each other. Mim investigated the lake, and an earworm shot out of it and quickly wormed inside her ear, giving her the ability to read and speak Goblin. Going further into the mine, they found a shaft that had some sort of forcefield on it, preventing more than one person being inside it at a time. They also found a room with several four-armed goblin skeletons that attacked them. Eventually they came to a bridge across a rushing river far below, but the bridge had been destroyed-probably the source of the explosion earlier. On the other side of the bridge sat Pust, the man that was in the jail of Whitecliff that freed them. He cryptically said that he knew they would lead him to the Shard, and that his master would be pleased - but he could not reveal who his master was. He then threw himself down into the river below. The group was able to get across the gap in the bridge thanks to Ghoulie (and Jeremiah executed a sick Tarzan swing). On the other side of the bridge, they came to a large cavern being guarded by two Emerald Claw. After dispatching them, they hid the bodies in the stalagmites and found a large, glowing purple locked door. Opening it revealed an ancient ruin. They found another group of goblinoid statues, one of which was holding the metal remains of a Musket. Jeremiah also found a grotesque, snake-like warforged that had several odd items embedded in it. Continuing on, they eventually came to a temple that had a glowing red light coming from it but was protected by a forcefield. Inside was Quinn with a young elven girl. Mim tapped on the forcefield with her musket and the girl turned around to inspect them. She looked young, but had large, skeletal wings, her skin was scaled like a dragon, and half her face was nothing but skull. A giant dragonmark covered the other half of her face, but it was clearly incomplete. She looked over the group and said, \u201cSo, after all this time, this is who the Chamber sends to stop me?\u201d then went for a closer look. She knew Mim was a changeling, and muttered that she would need to have Kel rein in his underlings. She told Jeremiah she felt the touch of the Silver Flame upon him, and that it had ripped his soul in half. She told Bob that she knew his father, and respected him, so it was a pity that he had to die in such a way. Then she saw Jasper, and said, \u201cThis must be the aberrant the prophecy spoke of,\u201d then she shot her hand through the force field, grabbed Jasper, and ripped him through. He fell unconscious and she put him over her shoulder, then grabbed the shard and teleported away before telling Quinn, \u201cMeet me in Sharn when you take care of the witnesses.\u201d","title":"2021 02 20"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-03-13/","tags":["session/recap","session/5"],"text":"The Heroes started in the Dhakaani temple. They saw Quinn\u2019s body melt away into nothingness, then long rested. While resting, Bob and Mim had a heart to heart about Mim\u2019s disregard for life, and then the group decided to rescue Jasper from Sharn. They backtracked through the mine and when they met the miners at the entrance, they told them that they saw the same thing - the bandits bodies just melted away into nothingness. They reached town without incident, but when they got there the Heroes saw a large, expensive-looking airship, emblazoned with the logo of House Tharashk and the name Hunter of the Skies . They met Jim\u2019s wife, Sheila, at the edge of town, and she told them that a Tharashk bounty hunter had come looking for them, thinking they killed his nephew and an heir to House Tharashk, Ven Leser. Mim went inside and dramatically billowed her cloak. Inside the pub, she saw Jim and the bounty hunter, Everest, at a table in the back. Ven Leser\u2019s butler, Percy, stood behind him, and whispered in Everest\u2019s ear as soon as he saw Mim. Mim tried to convince Everest that Percy was the one that betrayed and killed Ven Leser, but Everest didn\u2019t believe her, and he eventually revealed (through his magic scrying ring) that he figured the group would be reluctant to come with him, so his group went ahead and captured Conk. He told her to come back to the pub at dawn, or they would be putting Conk on trial for the murder - and he would probably be executed. Meanwhile, outside the pub, Jeremiah and Bob were talking to one of the bugbear guards about his whittling. While debating whether or not they could steal the airship, or if it was worth going with Everest to the Shadow Marches to be closer to Sharn, Jim told them it would be easier to go to Newthrone and book passage to Sharn on an airship there. He told them if they rescued Conk, they could use his boat to get away in the middle of the night. The group quickly came up with a plan - Jeremiah would be a distraction using the wand of pyrotechnics while Bob and Mim snuck on board the airship and rescued Conk from the bridge. They crept up to the ship and saw two guards posted at the base of the elemental ring, but before they could execute their plan, Merigold and Dinodas killed the guards and said, \u201cI\u2019m back, bitches!\u201d Merigold, Mim and Bob climbed up onto deck and Jeremiah then tried to cause the distraction, but the wand malfunctioned and started spewing fireworks everywhere. The sailors on board scrambled out of the galley in the chaos, thinking they were under attack. Everest started turning the ship to shoot the source of the fireworks with the cannons while Mim snuck down to the brig to save Conk. Bob snuck into the captains quarters and put one of the Vola\u2019khesh stones into Everest\u2019s coat, so they could listen to his thoughts, then trained his parrot to say he was never there to avoid suspicion. Merigold crept up behind Everest and attacked him, causing him to lurch in pain, making him angle the ship down towards the ground. Mim and Conk was pinned behind barrels in the cargo hold by the sudden lurching, and she asked Bob to come help her. After being rescued, she pulled out a torch and lit the cargo hold on fire. Merigold righted the wheel and jumped down on deck as Bob, Mim and Conk came up out of the hold. Jeremiah threw the wand away and returned to the ship to climb up it to help them, but as he was climbing, he saw everyone on the ship jump overboard. Mim, Conk and Merigold landed safely, but Bob crashed into the ground too hard and went unconscious. Jeremiah jumped down off the ship in a super hero pose, grabbed Bob\u2019s body, and the group fled the ship. They dropped Conk off at the pub, went to the pier, and cast off from Whitecliff as the Tharashk airship burned in the night sky behind them.","title":"2021 03 13"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-04-10/","tags":["session/recap","session/6"],"text":"mim: we could send a letter with the ring saying he\u2019s still alive or forge Ven Leser\u2019s handwriting BARDS IN NEWTHRONE The adventurers were floating down the river away from Whitecliff, watching the Tharashk airship burn in the night sky. Eventually, they entered the jungle, and the oppressive heat began to make Merigold and Mim feel miserable. Before settling in for the night, Mim brought up some ideas for getting House Tharashk off their tail - either faking being Ven Leser and sending the House his signet ring, or spreading a tale through the bards of Newthrone. After about a day of travelling, Mim started to get bored and dozed off at the wheel, sending the boat into a group of vines, which attacked! They wrapped around the boat and started trying to pull it apart. One of the vines grabbed GHOULY and flung him overboard before the group was able to cut themselves free. They continued their trek downriver, but the river was blocked by several dead brontosauruses floating across it. Several lizardfolk were on the debris, trying to clear it away. The group dropped anchor, Bob created a cold zone for Mim and Merigold to rest at, and Jeremiah and Bob rowed out to meet with the lizards. Drox, Chieftain of the Crazy Fist clan of the Cold Sun lizardfolk, spoke with them, and told Jeremiah how honored they were to have an Ember of the Silver Flame again after all these centuries of no contact, but that they still held up their end of keeping the demons in the Q\u2019Barran jungle at bay. While they were speaking, drumbeats began emanating from deep inside the jungle, and a rhythmic chanting rose, getting louder and louder, before cutting out suddenly with a bestial roaring. The chieftain explained that the blackscales were attempting to summon one of the ancient demons, and he sent a lizardfolk out to gather the clans for a tribal council, and offered the group shelter while the river was cleared.","title":"2021 04 10"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-05-15/","tags":["session/recap","session/7"],"text":"The session begins with the four of you walking through the dense undergrowth of the Q\u2019barran jungle with Drox, chieftain of the Crazy Fist Cold Sun. After a bit he calls for a halt and offers you each a bite of the secret Sun Cedar fruit, which makes you feel as if you\u2019ve just had a long rest. He led you further east into the gloomy, dark jungle. After another mile or so of hiking along a game trail, he called for a halt in a small clearing and began chatting with the four of you, specifically telling Jeremiah how honored he was that a Templar would visit them after all these centuries. He asked if Jeremiah would speak on their behalf at the tribal council, which Jeremiah agreed to. As the four of you were attacking, an arrow shot out at Drox, slamming into a tree near him. He quickly took cover and told the four of you to do the same as a large, jet-black lizardman dropped down to the forest floor with a wicked looking black obsidian sword that trailed a fine red mist as it moved through the air. This new lizardman told Drox that he was being lied to; one of his new companions was a Dust Lord. Jeremiah killed the blackscale just before it was able to escape, and the rest of you cleaned up the remaining lizardmen except for one that Bob saw swing away in the trees. Drox confronted the four of you about being a member of the Lords of Dust, and it was discovered that Bob\u2019s coin was a Coin of Dust - allowing the Lords to track the group. Drox took it and said the coin was the trapped soul of an evil Raksasha, which Jeremiah realized was the evil tiger-looking creature from his vision. Drox said the shamans of his tribe would be able to cleanse the coin. You continued through the jungle and eventually made it to the Crazy Fist clanhold, where hundreds of lizardfolk were swinging through the treetops between buildings and platforms built in the canopy. He lead you up the stairs to the first landing and took his leave of you, saying he had clan business to attend to, but a servant would see to your needs. Bob peaced out, looking for a shop, but finding the lizardfolk prices much to exorbitant for his tastes. The rest of you were being led through the platforms along rope bridges, but before you could make it to the guest house a large Cold Sun lizardfolk challenged Jeremiah about what he was actually doing here, since the Silver Flame had abandoned them years ago. Jeremiah was able to talk him down, and you were told that he was a member of the Grey Ash clan, who hate the Silver Flame.","title":"2021 05 15"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-09-10/","tags":["session/recap","session/8"],"text":"The group started the session entering the guesthouse in the Cold Sun Clanhold. Yoss warned you that blood feuds would be settled during the night. Exploring the house, they noticed the view from the balcony overlooked the jungle to the east, where the could see a massive volcano spewing smoke into the air, surrounded by dark black storm clouds. As they watched, they felt a rumble shake the tree, then saw the volcano erupt, spewing lava high into the air. Bob began trying to calculate the distance to the volcano, but was struggling to pinpoint it through the haze and smoke. Soon after, Drox entered the room followed by four lizardfolk carrying a massive, dark grey wooden chest. He told the group that the chest had been left there by the first Silver Flame Templar, Tira Moran, and asked them to hold onto it until \u201cthe return\u201d. He considered Jeremiah the rightful owner of the chest and handed over to him. Inside was the Longsword of Verdict, a pair of simple leather gauntlets trimmed with silver inlayed with gold, and a large amount of ancient Galifarian gold coins. Bob went outside to try to get a better view of the volcano, and a random passerby noticed him looking out at it and told him he could get a better look from the overlook at the top of the tree. He began climbing the steps when another rumble shook the tree, harder this time. After a few flights of stairs, he noticed a lizardfolk clawhook into the treetop above him and realized he was being followed - by the person that told him to go to the top of the tree.","title":"2021 09 10"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2021-10-02/","tags":["session/recap","session/9"],"text":"The group started the session divided. Bob had started working his way up to the canopy of the clantree to get a better view of the Volcano, but soon realized he was being followed. Mim and Merigold went to bed, and Josiah was speaking to Drox and attuning to his new greatsword. Bob was attacked by the lizardfolk following when he started to head towards a blood fued being settled, while simultaneously the clan witch of the Cold Sun entered the greathouse with her huge muscled bodyguard who was wearing an incredible shimmering rainbow cloak. She displayed the coin of dust that Bob had been carried and ominously asked where the carrier of the coin was, because everyone was in grave danger. Mim and Merigold entered the room, and Mim asked what was going on. She tried to call Bob on her cellstone but he ignored the call, making her mad - so she threw a plant at the coin and left the room. Merigold tried to stop her but was too slow, and when the plant struck the coin it exploded into dust. Bob and the lizardfolk continued flailing at each other. When the dust settled from the coin, a huge humanoid tiger was standing in the room. Jeremiah recognized it as the same race of tiger creatures he was fighting in his vision. The great witch, Agathax, had been thrown outside by the force of the magical blast and was unconscious. Mim saw her bodyguard lift her up and run towards the middle of the tree. The tiger creature said something in a deep guttural language that none of you understood, then attacked Drox. It killed Drox, then before you could kill it, it plane shifted away. Merigold and Jeremiah went to find Bob, while Mim went to a bar. She eventually decided to try to find the great witch to get some answers. Merigold and Jeremiah found Bob and saved him, but Jeremiah executed the lizardfolk.

A large templar was squatting in front of him, fully armored in gleaming silver platemail, and behind them was a large bonfire blazing in front of an ornate citadel.

The lady of death is the key. Find the seekers of the Draconic Prophecy - your group was unforeseen and can work outside the bounds of fate.\u201d And then she threw Jeremiah into the flame. Meanwhile, Merigold and Bob were running from a large group of greyscaled lizardfolk back to their guesthouse. Bob felt Jeremiah\u2019s body grow warm as he carried him, and then Jeremiah jerked awake, his skin turning a dull silver. By the time they got back, Dinodas had eaten the the clan leader\u2019s body, Drox. Mim started to go towards Agathax the witch but realized she did not know where to go and was disoriented due to the incoming storm. Yoss the servant ran up to her and was asking her what happened back there, and when she mentioned she was trying to find Agathax, he said he\u2019d lead her there. After a particularly perilous bridge crossing due to the wind, he gave her a clawhook to use just in case. After reaching the platform just before the witch house, suddenly the lanterns on the platform all flew off, casting the platform into pitch blackness. A massive, looming shape appeared in a flash of lightning, and suddenly attacked Yoss, nearly killing him, before Mim yelled out that they were friends - and then she saw the shimmering cloak of Agathax\u2019s bodyguard.

Merigold looked out towards the volcano in time to see it explode in a shower of lava and a massive dragon flew up out of it. Shortly after a blackscaled lizardfolk dropped onto the balcony and attacked. Bob made some bombs for Merigold and Jeremiah to use, and some greyscaled lizardfolk were able to squeeze through the door. Merigold killed the blackscale by hitting some blast powder that Bob slipped into his back pocket, and the greyscaled lizardfolk fled. Agathax was floating in mid air inside the witch house, wrapped in a soft purple light. She mentally spoke to Mim, who asked her about what the templar told Jeremiah. She said that the lizard clans had maintained contact with the Seekers of the Draconic Prophecy, but she did not know where they were - other than that they had an enclave in Sharn.","title":"2021 10 30"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2022-01-22/","tags":["session/recap","session/11"],"text":"The group long rested. Throughout the night, Mim was woken by the sounds of Agathax\u2019s bodyguard fighting, but was still able to get a full long rest in. The next morning she opened her eyes to see that Agathax had recovered and was staring at her. The bodyguard was slumped against the wall, covered in blood, holding his side. Agathax insisted he was fine. Mim told Agathax that Drox was dead, and Agathax said they should meet up with the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Merigold was watching the distant volcano as the dragon circled it. Bob made a pair of glider wings for Jeremiah while Jeremiah admired his new armor, where he could now see flames dancing in the reflections across it. Merigold suddenly realized that she couldn\u2019t see the dragon in the sky any longer. Agathax revealed to Mim that the dragon was Rashaak, the protector of the jungle, but he has not emerged from the volcano in a thousand years and she does not know what has provoked it. She also mentioned that the nights before clan meets are normally dangerous, but last night far more so - she fears something terrible has started. On the way to the guest house where the others are, Mim, Agathax and the bodyguard were attacked by Blackscales, but Agathax destroyed them.

Agathax revealed the history of the Overlords and the dragons, as well as who Tira Moran was when Jeremiah revealEd he was not actually a Templar. As they were speaking the ground began to rumble, slowly getting stronger until they heard a massive boom. Agathax turned to the volcano in time to see it explode once again, sending the top skyward in a massive plume of ash and lava. Out of the volcano flew Rhashaak, heading straight for the clan tree. Agathax told the group to flee. Mim asked if she could have her bodyguard\u2019s cloak since they expected to die, and he laughed and threw it to her. The group fled quickly but as they were running to the boats Jeremiah was tackled by Krot, the grey scale. The group fought the Lizardfolk off and made it to their boat. Pust, the weird shadow dude, was waiting there for them.","title":"2022 02 12"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2022-02-26/","tags":["session/recap","session/13"],"text":"Mim expertly navigated the boat down river, eventually bringing the group to Newthrone - but not before Bob became addicted to gambling. Airships swarmed through the skies above the city, but one airship in particular was familiar to the group as the House Tharashk airship they burned down. After much debate about how to disguise themselves from the bounty hunters, and decided to just keep their hoods up. Mim docked the boat and paid a dockhand to drive the boat back upriver. Bob was entranced by the tourist traps, and Merigold nearly killed a man over a grain of rice. Eventually they began making their way to the Gray Tide hideout that Mim remembered from her past travels. On the way, they ran into a group of children who immediately recognized them as the Heroes of Whitecliff. They hounded them with questions, and talked about how Everest was going to kill them and send something called an Inquisitor after them. Continuing on, they found a newsboy selling the latest issue of the Newthrone Gazette, which they purchased and read. They made it to the Hideout, finding Lars. He told them the only way they were getting on an airship was sneaking on one, stealing one, or getting a job - and he knew the Newthrone Gazette was hiring. Believing the Gazette would be flying to Sharn soon to cover the Race of the Eight Winds, they headed out. On the way, Bob checked in on the stone they planted in Everest\u2019s cloak, where he saw one of the children that was asking them questions tell him they were in town.","title":"2022 02 26"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2022-10-17/","tags":["session/recap","session/14"],"text":"The group had begun heading towards the Newthrone Gazette, hoping to convince Harvey to give them a ride to Sharn. On the way, they heard a little orphan boy yelling that a bounty had been placed on the Heroes of 10,000 gold. Suddenly, Mim noticed that he sped off. Mim remembered a tavern that she used to frequent that everyone loved: Raymond\u2019s Respite. They made their way there and saw a beautiful man peering in the window. Inside was dimly lit with few patrons. The group got a table in the back and were discussing next steps when the door suddenly slammed open and four of the beautiful people walked in. The bartender identified them as Rierdrans and was quick to level a crossbow at the newcomers but they froze him in place with hardly an effort. The Rierdrans walked up to a Kalashtar man who was sitting at the bar ignoring them; they began provoking the Kalashtar and Jeremiah rose to defend him. A chaotic, wacky battle ensued that resulted in a Shifter man realizing he needs to get his life back together, an orc being murdered by Mim\u2019s dagger, and two of the Rierdrans fleeing.","title":"2022 10 17"},{"location":"Post%20Session%20Logs/2022-11-19/","tags":["session/recap","session/15"],"text":"The party began interrogating the new mysterious Kalashtar man; Goldie and Mim (because she was charmed) advocated for him, and they took him with them to the Gazette. On the way to the gazette, it felt like eyes were on them and people were watching them the whole way. They made it to the building without incident, though, and entered. Harvey (the one who interviewed them) saw and quickly recognized Bob as a Hero of Whitecliff, but they were able to convince him he wasn\u2019t, and that they could help him out with getting his airship free of the Tharask blockade. They revealed themselves as the Heroes and Harvey gave them two options - they could try to get to the airship and outrun the blockade, or they could cause a distraction by destroying an armor depot nearby. Bob and Jeremiah didn\u2019t trust Harvey so they went with him to wait at the airship. Mim, Goldie and Nameless went to the armory and tried to walk in the door, where they were attacked by flesh golems. Goldie used a crane to lift Mim up to an open window, where she snuck in, grabbed a set of keys, opened the door to the explosive room, stole a grenade and blew it sky high. She was able to grab Nameless\u2019 whip and be pulled out of the armory as it went up in flames. The Tharashk airships began landing as hordes of guards ran towards the armory.","title":"2022 11 19"}]}
