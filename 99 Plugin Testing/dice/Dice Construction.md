### Arrangement

Common dice are small [cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), most often 1.6 cm (0.63 in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called [pips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(counting) "Pip (counting)"). (While the use of [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals") is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)

Opposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, requiring the 1, 2, and 3 faces to share a [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)"). The faces of a die may be placed [clockwise or counterclockwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwise_and_counterclockwise "Clockwise and counterclockwise") about this vertex. If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called "right-handed". If those faces run clockwise, the die is called "left-handed". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.

The pips on standard six-sided dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. Red fours may be of Indian origin.

### Manufacturing

Non-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic [injection molding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_molding "Injection molding") process. The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. Different pigments can be added to the dice to make them opaque or transparent, or multiple pigments may be added to make the dice speckled or marbled.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-19)

The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a [tumble finishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumble_finishing "Tumble finishing") process similar to [rock polishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_polishing "Rock polishing"). The [abrasive agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(mechanical) "Abrasion (mechanical)") scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also creates the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-awesomedice-20)

Precision casino dice may have a polished or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") as the material used for the dice, such that the center of gravity of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. This mitigates concerns that the pips will cause a small bias. All such dice are stamped with a [serial number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_number "Serial number") to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.

### Etymology and terms

The word die comes from [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French") _[dé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%A9#Old_French "wikt:dé")_; from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") _[datum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/datum#Latin "wikt:datum")_ "something which is given or played".

While the terms _[ace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace "Ace")_, _deuce_, _trey_, _cater_, _cinque_ and _sice_ are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. _Ace_ is from the Latin _as_, meaning "a unit"; the others are 2 to 6 in [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French"). The term "[snake eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps#Names_of_rolls "Craps")" is the outcome of rolling the dice and getting only one [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(counting) "Pip (counting)") on each die. The _[Online Etymology Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Etymology_Dictionary "Online Etymology Dictionary")_ traces use of the term as far back as 1919. The term "[boxcars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcars "Boxcars")", also known as "midnight", is the outcome of rolling the dice and getting a six on each die. The pair of six pips resembles a pair of boxcars on a freight train.
