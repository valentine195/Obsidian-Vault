Typical role-playing dice, showing a variety of colors and styles. Note the older hand-inked green 12-sided die (showing an 11), manufactured before pre-inked dice were common. Many players collect or acquire a large number of mixed and unmatching dice.

Polyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game _[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons "Dungeons & Dragons")_ (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like _[Exalted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exalted "Exalted")_ which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation "Dice notation") is frequently used.

Many board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as _[Axis & Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_%26_Allies "Axis & Allies")_, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In _[Castles of Burgundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castles_of_Burgundy "Castles of Burgundy")_, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die's value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In _[Quarriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarriors "Quarriors")_ (and its descendant, Dicemasters), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-36)

Dice can be used for [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination "Divination") and using dice for such a purpose is called [cleromancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy "Cleromancy"). A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this [method of divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_(divination) "Mo (divination)"). It is highly likely that the [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans") used the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids "Platonic solids") as dice. They referred to such dice as "the dice of the gods" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-37)

Astrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_node "Orbital node") of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the [Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball "Magic 8-Ball"), conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.

Dice can be used to generate random numbers for use in [passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password "Password") and [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") applications. The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") describes a method by which dice can be used to generate [passphrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase "Passphrase").[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-38) [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware "Diceware") is a method recommended for generating secure but memorable passphrases, by repeatedly rolling five dice and picking the corresponding word from a pre-generated list.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#cite_note-39)

# Notation

In many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A "d" or "D" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example, `d4` denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence, `6d8` means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, `3d6+4` instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.
