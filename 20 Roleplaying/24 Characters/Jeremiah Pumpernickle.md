### Past
Born in Aundair. Fought in The Last War and was about to perish. In an act of desperation, he transferred his spirit to a nearby warforged body. The spirit survived but parts of him remain dormant as the body is nothing like his own, thus some of his memories are suppressed and does not remember this transferal occurring.

He spirit struggled to keep its humanity in this artificial vessel for decades, but seeing people in need would awaken these human emotions in him. The machine part of him does not understand what is happening and is seeking answers. ^b8cbee

His innate desire to help those in need naturally drew him to the Cyran refugees, in an attempt to discover what was happening to him. It worked for a while in the beginning, but over time the constancy of their began to dull his emotions. He now seeks to help those in greater need to find himself again.
