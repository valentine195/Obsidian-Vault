1. SWADDLING: Snug wrapping 2. SIDE/STOMACH: Lying on the side or stomach (only when you are there with your baby; never for sleep) 3. SHUSHING: Strong white noise 4. SWINGING: Tiny rhythmic, jiggly motions (just one inch, back and forth) 5. SUCKING: Sucking on your nipple, a clean finger, or a pacifier These steps may not sound very innovative, but what is revolutionary is that—when done exactly right—these steps (called the 5 S’s) usually settle baby screams in seconds. (And, when done incorrectly, they do nothing…or even cause more crying!) — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TCI48AE&location=303)

Note: Swaddling by itself often fails to calm fussing, but it prepares your baby to focus on the next “layers” you add…which will turn on the calming reflex. Next comes the side/stomach position. The back is the only safe position when you place your baby down, but it usually worsens crying…making them feel that they’re falling. The side or stomach creates a sense of safety, and for many babies it’s super-effective at turning on the calming reflex. The next two layers are shushing and swinging. Both are potent triggers of the calming reflex. They relax your baby so she can escape the cycle of crying and notice all your wonderful cuddling and feeding. Last, but not least, sucking is the icing on the cake. It keeps the calming reflex turned on and gives infants a profound sense of peace. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TCI48AE&location=320)

Is your baby opening his mouth and rooting or putting his hand up to his lips? This could be a sign of early hunger. • Is he rubbing his eyes, yawning, blinking, or staring out with glassy eyes? This usually means fatigue. • Does he seem to intentionally look away from you or is he hiccupping? This could mean overstimulation. • Is he grimacing, grunting, and trying to bear down? This could indicate the need to poop or simply that he feels food making its way through his intestines. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TCI48AE&location=468)

To avoid turning your baby into a hot potato: • Check the ears and neck. If the ears are red and hot and the neck is sweaty, your baby is too warm. Dress her more lightly or cool the room. If her ears are cold, use a little more clothing or warm up the room. • Don’t overbundle with thick blankets, extra layers of clothing, or hats. • Never use electric blankets or heating pads. These overheat babies and expose them to electromagnetic radiation. • In hot weather, use just a diaper and light muslin swaddle. Sprinkle on a dusting of cornstarch powder—never talcum powder—to absorb sweat and prevent rashes. — location: [1651](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TCI48AE&location=1651)

Windshield Wiper: Using Your Lap to Quiet Your Baby The windshield wiper combines all the 5 S’s for a perfect soothing experience. It’s one of my favorite ways of switching on the calming reflex. Here’s what to do: 1. Swaddle your baby (1st S), then sit in a comfy chair with your knees touching and your feet flat on the floor, shoulder distance apart. Sitting forward works best. 2. Place your baby on his side…in the groove between your legs (2nd S). His cheek and head will be in your palm and outstretched fingers, on top of your knees, and his ankles on your hip. 3. Slide your other hand under his head so your two hands overlap and his head is cradled in a loose, open grasp. 4. Roll him toward his stomach, soften your shoulders, take a deep breath, and let your body relax. 5. Lean over his body and shhhh by his ear (the 3rd S). Shush as loud as he’s crying. 6. Now, swing your knees side to side—like a windshield wiper (4th S). If he’s crying, make faster (two to three beats per second) smaller moves (one inch from side to side) and open your hands to let his head jiggle, like Jell-O. 7. Finally, offer a pacifier (5th S). — location: [2390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00TCI48AE&location=2390)
