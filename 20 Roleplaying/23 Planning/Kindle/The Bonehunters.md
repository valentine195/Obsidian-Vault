Sixty paces in, they reached an intersection. An arched barrier was before them, shimmering like a vertical pool of quicksilver. Corridors went to the right and left, both appearing to curve inward in the distance. Icarium drew out a coin from the pouch at his belt, and Mappo was amused to see that it was of a vintage five centuries old. ‘You are the world’s greatest miser, Icarium.’ The Jhag smiled, then shrugged. ‘I seem to recall that no-one ever accepts payment from us, no matter how egregious the expense of the service provided. Is that an accurate memory, Mappo?’ ‘It is.’ ‘Well, then, how can you accuse me of being niggardly?’ He tossed the coin at the silver barrier. It vanished. Ripples rolled outward, went beyond the stone frame, then returned. ‘This is a passive manifestation,’ Icarium said. ‘Tell me, did you hear the coin strike anything beyond?’ ‘No, nor did it make a sound upon entering the…uh, the door.’ ‘I am tempted to pass through.’ ‘That might prove unhealthy.’ Icarium hesitated, then drew a skinning-knife and inserted the blade into the barrier. Gentler ripples. He pulled it out. The blade looked intact. None of the substance had adhered to it. Icarium ran a fingertip along the iron. ‘No change in temperature,’ he observed. ‘Shall I try a finger I won’t miss much?’ Mappo asked, holding up his left hand. ‘And which one would that be, friend?’ ‘I don’t know. I expect I’d miss any of them.’ ‘The tip?’ ‘Sound caution.’ Making a fist, barring the last, smallest finger, Mappo stepped close, then dipped the finger up to the first knuckle into the shimmering door. ‘No pain, at least. It is, I think, very thin.’ He drew his hand back and examined the digit. ‘Hale.’ ‘With the condition of your fingers, Mappo, how can you tell?’ ‘Ah, I see a change. No dirt left, not even crusted under the nail.’ ‘To pass through is to be cleansed. Do you think?’ Mappo reached in with his whole hand. ‘I feel air beyond. Cooler, damper.’ He withdrew his hand and peered at it. ‘Clean. Too clean. I am alarmed.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Because it makes me realize how filthy I’ve become, that’s why.’ ‘I wonder, will it do the same with our clothes?’ ‘That would be nice, although it may possess some sort of threshold. Too filthy, and it simply annihilates the offending material. We might emerge on the other side naked.’ ‘Now I am alarmed, friend.’ ‘Yes. Well, what shall we do, Icarium?’ ‘Do we have any choice?’ With that, the Jhag strode through the barrier. Mappo sighed, then followed. Only to be clutched at the shoulder and pulled back from a second step – which, he saw, would have been into empty air. The cavern before them was vast. A bridge had once connected the ledge they stood on to an enormous, towering fortress floating in space, a hundred or more paces opposite them. Sections of that stone span remained, seemingly unsupported, but others had broken away and now floated, motionless, in the air. Far below, dizzyingly far, the cavern was swallowed in darkness.
