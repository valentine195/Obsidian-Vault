# Ghaal'duur

Held by:

### Description

> This three-foot warhorn, a revered artifact of Dhakaan, is carved from the tip of a red dragon’s horn, banded with adamantine, and covered with runes of power. An inscription in Goblin reads “A mighty dirge for the fallen foe.” _Ghaal’duur_ was crafted by Jhazaal Dhakaan, a legendary dirge singer who united the ancient warring clans. Any kech warlord who obtained it would gain great influence among the Heirs of Dhakaan—and any non- Dhakaani that possesses it bears a dangerous burden.

### Use

**_Random Properties._** The warhorn has the following randomly determined properties:

• 2 minor beneficial properties

• 1 minor detrimental property; any goblinoid attuned to this warhorn is immune to the detrimental effects of this property.

**_Jhazaal’s Presence._** While you possess and are attuned to the horn, your Charisma score is increased by 4, and your maximum for this score is 24.

**_The Dragon’s Song._** When holding the warhorn in both hands, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bard spells cast using the warhorn gain the following benefits.

• If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, its duration is doubled, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

• If the spell has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range is doubled.

• If the spell is 1st level or higher, it is cast as if from a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell slot you expended.

**_The Sound of Victory._** While holding the warhorn in both hands, you can use an action to blow it, empowering your allies and intimidating your foes. For the next 10 minutes, any time an ally within 600 feet of you that can hear you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. If the creature is a goblinoid, it adds 2d4 instead of 1d4 to its roll.

Additionally, every enemy within 600 feet of you that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw against your bard spell save DC; on a failed saving throw, for the next 10 minutes, anytime it makes an attack roll or a saving throw, the creature must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. If the creature is a goblinoid, it subtracts 2d4 instead of 1d4 from its roll.

Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

**_Destroying the Horn._** It’s said that only the fire of Jharaashta, the dragon who sacrificed his horn for its creation, can destroy the horn. But after nine thousand years, most sages assume that the mighty dragon is long dead.
