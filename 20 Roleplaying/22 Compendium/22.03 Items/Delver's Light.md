# Delver's Light

Held by: [[Jeremiah Pumpernickle]]

### Description

A brilliant yellow gem that glows with a faint inner radiance. This item can only be attuned by a warforged, requiring that it be integrated into that warforged's head or chest.

### Use

A creature attuned to this item can use a bonus action to shine either dim or bright light in a 50 foot radius, or to shine either bright or dim light in a 100 foot cone. The light can be turned off by using another bonus action to do so.
