# Earworm

Held by: [[Mim]]

### Description

### Use

To attune to this symbiont, you must hold it against the skin behind your ear for the entire attunement period, whereupon it burrows into your head and bonds to your skull. While the _earworm_ is inside you, you can speak, read, and write Deep Speech and Goblin.

#### Spells.

The _earworm_ has 4 charges. You can cast the following spells from it, expending the necessary number of charges (spell save DC 15):

- [detect thoughts](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb) (2 charges)
- [dissonant whispers](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dissonant%20whispers_phb) (1 charge).

Each time you use the _earworm_ to cast the [detect thoughts](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20thoughts_phb) spell, it sends the information gleaned to the nearest daelkyr, or to the next nearest _earworm_ until it reaches a daelkyr.

If the earworm runs out of charges while you are attuned to it, you have to make a wisdom saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion.

The _earworm_ regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Curse

#### Symbiotic Nature.

The _earworm_ can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the _earworm_ ends, and it exits your body.
