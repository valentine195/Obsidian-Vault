 # Shield Of The Silver Flame
Held by: [[Jeremiah Pumpernickle]]
 
 ### Description
>  _A sturdy, silvered great-shield, intricately emblazoned with the fiery arrowhead emblem of the Silver Flame._
 
 ### Use

#### Current

- **2/rest:** Cast daylight at will
- **2/rest:** If a creature misses an attack against you, you can use your reaction to attempt to blind them. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is blinded for 1 minute. The creature may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded. A creature blinded in this fashion cannot be blinded by the shield again until the next dawn.

##### Ideas

Can cause ground around them to smolder in silvery-blue flame, dealing DOT

2/rest: Can use reaction to shield opponent

Can thrust into the ground, causing a [wall of flame](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wall%20of%20Fire#content) to burst forth from the shield
