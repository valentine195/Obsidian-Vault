 # Shattered Blade
Held by:
 
 ### Description
 > A well-made basic longsword whose blade was shattered into pieces. Three of the largest pieces were collected and stitched together through magic, creating a blade of floating fragments encased in a swirling mist. 
 
 ### Use
 
_**Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)**_
+1 longsword

This +1 longsword, while functioning as a single weapon, seems to be instead a series of three broken shards of a blade, reassembled and suspended in their proper shape through magic.

As an action, you can fire one or more of these shards at one or more enemies 30 feet or less away. They fly unerringly and deal **1d4+1 piercing damage**. These are automatically blocked if the enemy casts the Shield spell.

Each missing shard causes the long sword to act as the following:

| Shards Used | Weapon     | Damage Die |  
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | 
| 0           | Longsword  | 1d8 + 1    |  
| 1           | Shortsword | 1d6 + 1    | 
| 2           | Dagger     | 1d4 + 1    |
| 3           | Hilt       | 1d1 + 1    |  


If Dispel Magic is used on this sword, it collapses into a pile of shards and a hilt, losing all magical properties.
