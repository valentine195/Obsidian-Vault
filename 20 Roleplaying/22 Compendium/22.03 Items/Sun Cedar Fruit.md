 # Sun Cedar Fruit
 
 ### Description
 
 A large fruit that looks like a wrinkly, golden coconut. The flesh is bright white and glows with a soft inner light. 
 
 ### Use
 
The fruit is slightly sweet and juicy, and as you eat it you feel your body healing itself. After just a few moments, you also feel completely refreshed -- as if you've just had a peaceful long rest.
