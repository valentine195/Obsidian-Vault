# Vola’khesh

Held by:

### Description

This small carved stone is typically bound to a leather strap worn around the wrist or neck. Designed by the Dhakaani duur’kala, the _vola’khesh_ facilitates communication between elite units. They are created in linked sets; up to ten stones can be bound together, and once established, this link cannot be changed.

#### History

At present, the vola’khesh are only used by the Kech Dhakaan and are unknown to the people of the Five Nations. If the enchantments were replicated, these tools could be put into use by spies and law enforcement agencies of the Five Nations.

### Use

While wearing a _vola’khesh_, you can use a bonus action to whisper a message. This message is heard by all creatures within 120 feet wearing a linked vola’khesh. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood will block this effect, but the magic doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
