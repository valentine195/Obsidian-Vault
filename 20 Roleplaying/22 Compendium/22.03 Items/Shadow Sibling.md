# Shadow Sibling

Held by:

### Description

> Crafted by Dyrrn the Corruptor, this black jewel-like object fuses to the center of your forehead when you attune to it.

### Use

As a bonus action, you can cause the shadow sibling to exude or retract an ectoplasmic shadow that surrounds your body and conceals you from prying eyes. While the shadow is active, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

In addition, when you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to spend one Hit Die to shield yourself. Roll the die and add the result as a bonus to your AC, including against the triggering attack. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.

### Curse
#### **Symbiotic Nature**.
The shadow sibling can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the shadow sibling ends, and you can remove it.
