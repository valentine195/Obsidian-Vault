## Voice Acting Tips

##### Pitch
	High <-> Low

##### Articulators

These are your lips, tongue, mouth, teeth, etc. They are all the components that you use to create your voice subconsciously - changing any of them changes the way your voice sounds.

###### Lips

Changing lip shape can dramatically change the sound of your voice.

###### Jaw
 - Forward
 - Back
 - Side

###### Tongue

- Against front of bottom teeth
- Pulled into the middle
- Against roof of mouth
	
##### Impediments (use sparingly)

###### Lisp

Most people do an exaggerated lisp. Use the bump behind the front of the teeth when making an S sound (like making an L sound).

###### Stammering

- Stutter - involuntary repitition
- Prolonguing - get stuck on letter sounds (mmmMmmmmaybe)

###### Shaky Voice

Tighten vocal cords and... make it shaky.
