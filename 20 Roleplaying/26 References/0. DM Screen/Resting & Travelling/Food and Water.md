# FOOD

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.

Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end o f each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

# WATER

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot.

A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or m ore levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
