### Squeezing Into Smaller Spaces

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it.

Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide.

While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.

Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while itâ€™s in the smaller space.
