In a **lightly obscured** area, such as **dim light**, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have **disadvantage** on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as **darkness**, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the **blinded** condition.

**Darkvision enables a character to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light.** In darkness, at least some light is necessary for dark vision to function. If the light is dim enough as to be very near darkness, a character's darkvision may be limited in the DM's discretion.

**EQUIPMENT**

**Torch** - A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

**Lantern, Bullseye** - A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

**Lantern, Hooded** - A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

**Candle** - For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
