### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.

**Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.**

You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.
