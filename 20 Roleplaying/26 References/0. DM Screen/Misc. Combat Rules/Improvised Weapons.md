### Improvised Weapons

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).

If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage.

An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM â€™s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus
