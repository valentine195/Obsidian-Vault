### Concentration

**You can move and attack as normal.**

**You can end concentration at any time (no action required).**

**Concentration Is Broken If:** 
- You cast another spell that requires concentration. 
- When You Take Damage: Make a Con save. The DC is 10 or 1/2 the damage you take, whichever is higher. Fail = lose concentration. 
- If you are incapacitated or you die. 
- Environment: If you're on a ship hit by a wave or something like that, you might have to make a DC 10 Con save to maintain concentration.
