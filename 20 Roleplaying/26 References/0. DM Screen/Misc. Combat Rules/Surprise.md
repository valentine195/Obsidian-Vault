### Surprise

**Surprised:** You can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends.

This also includes bonus actions ("...anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action").

**Procedure**

-   The DM figures out if anyone is surprised.
   
-   Everyone rolls initiative.
   
-   Take turns. Those who are surprised probably can't do anything.
