## Characters

list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start
> The servant opens the door to the guesthouse, and you step into a utilitarian common room. A wooden table large enough to sit eight people sits to your left, along with a small pantry, and on the right are several sitting chairs arrayed around an unlit stone fireplace.  In the back there are three beds along one side, but most of the back is open and you have a balcony. It seems the clan tree is on the crest of a high cliff, and you can see far over the jungle to the east, where are you can see a massive volcano spewing black smoke into the air. The servant enters behind you, still limping and with a pained look on his face, and then stands to one side. He says: 

> [!quote] Yoss
> I have been instructed by my master to see to your needs. The full clanhold is at your disposal, but I must warn you - the other clans have begun arriving, and blood fueds may be settled this night. Beware the Gray Ash. Please let me know if you require anything.

> [!info: ]
> As you take in the house, you hear a deep, distant, rolling rumble that goes on for several seconds. The servant walks to the balcony  and stares out, where you can see the volcano surrounded by massive dark storm clouds.
> ```ad-quote

> Hmm. [[Haka'Torvhak]] awakens. Bad omen on the eve of the clanmeet.

> Another rumble shakes the house, causing the furniture to

**SWITCH TO BOB**

> [!info]
> While the three of you are in the house, Bob, where would you like to go?

> [!info]
> 
> Bob, as you move through the village, Lizardfolk are swinging through the trees all around you. Most of the platforms you can see around you are teeming with groups of them going about their day, and you begin to see signs of the different clans - you see a group all wearing bright golden feathers, another who have all painted their faces red, and a third with bones tied to their clothing that rattle as they move. You hear a long, low rumble of thunder from far to the east, where you can see a massive dark cloud rising up into the air.

> Bob, give me a perception check.
> `dice: 1d20` -> Stealth Roll 1

> > [!success]-
> > As you move through the crowds, you catch a glimpse of a lizardfolk with ashy-grey skin clawhook his way into the treetop above you, but you don't see him afterwards. You suddenly realize that he's been following you, as you have caught fleeting glimpses of him a few times now.

## Scenes

### Delivery of the Chest

> You hear a soft knock on the door and Yoss cracks it open, peering outside. He exchanges a few soft words, then opens the door and [[Drox]] steps in. He bows to Jeremiah, then says:
>
> ```ad-info
> title: Drox
> Templar, for millenia have we stood vigilant against the Dust Lords, long awaiting the return of your order to complete the tasks set before us by the first templar, [[Tira Miran]]. She told us the Templars would return to us in strength when we most needed them, and here you stand.
> 
> Jeremiah, one of the tasks she entrusted to my clan was to guard this chest of the Flame until the return, and guarded it we have. It is now yours.
>```
>
> He bows, then steps aside as four lizardfolk enter the room, burdened by weight of a massive dark grey chest.



> [!treasure]
> The chest is rather large but plainly designed, made out of a dark grey wood that you, Mim, recognize as Xen'Drik'n floatwood used by some Lhazaar pirates for shipbuilding. Two leather latches secure it. The chest looks brand new, despite its apparent age, and the lid is easy to open despite its weight.
> 
> The chest is full of ancient Galifarian gold coins, still depicting the first king of Khorvaire. Resting on top of the coins is a longsword made out of the same floatwood as the chest, lacquered and polished until its surface shines. Half buried underneath the gold is a pair of silver-armored leather gauntlets, palms glowing with a soft blue sigil.

> - [[Gauntlets of Deliverance]]
> - `dice: 4d57 + 1600` gold


### Bob Meets the Shamans

- "This coin... it has left a filth on you"
- The three ancient lizard women sit in a circle facing the middle of the hut, and [[Chiax]] gestures for you to sit in the middle of them.
- All three begin chanting in unison, and dozens of candles flare to life around the edge of the hut with a bright green flame that casts flickering shadows as a wind begins to blow.
- She shudders, then draws a deep, ragged breath and looks up with empty eyes that slowly turn black. She stares through you, unseeing, then throws her head back:
	
	> _THE LADY OF DEATH, BLIND TO HER SHROUD OF DUST
	> WORKS TO UNDO HER TERRIBLE CURSE
	> BUT IN DOING SO, SHE WILL
	> THE WORLD WILL MOURN
	> AS IT DID WITH YOUR FATHER'S DEATH_
