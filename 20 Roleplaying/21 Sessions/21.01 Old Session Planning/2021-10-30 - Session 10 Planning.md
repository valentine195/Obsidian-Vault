## Characters

list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start

> Bob and Merigold, you are standing above Jeremiah's unconscious form. You hear a commotion from across a bridge, where several grey-scaled lizardfolk are pointing at you and gesturing wildy. Rain has begun to fall from the volcanic storm, and the sky is beginning to darken as the storm moves towards the tree. What are you doing?

*After they answer, go to Mim*

> Mim, you start moving towards the middle of the Clan Tree in search of Agathax the witch. As you head out, you hear someone rushing up towards you and see Yoss, Drox's servant, rushing up to you. He reaches you and catches his breath, then says, "Mistress Mim, is Drox dead? Where is Agathax? What happened back there?"
>
> "The clan witch? Agathax was hurt? Her warden must have taken her to the witchhouse, in the center of the clan tree."

## Scenes

### Vision of the Flame

> 
> Jeremiah, you open your eyes to see that you're laying on top of a stepped pyramid overlooking a sprawling city. [[Tira Moran|Someone]] in bright, shining, silver full plate armor is crouched down staring at you through a visor. Behind them you can see a large roaring bonfire in front of an ornate citadel. When they notice you're awake, they stand up and walk to the edge of the platform, and the bonfire's flames reflecting off their plate make them glow with a soft silver light. Over her shoulder, she calls:

> She turns to regard you, the flames dancing in her gleaming armor. She lifts her visor and you see rugged looking woman, her face scarred by battle.

### Agathax the Witch

> Yoss leads you towards the center of the tree. The storm is beginning to pick up strength, and the rope bridges he leads you across are starting to sway in the wind. The sky is darkening quickly as night falls and the storm approaches. After a particularly strong gust of wind causes the bridge you are crossing to swing violently, Yoss stops you and hands you a clawhook. "Mistress Mim, this storm, it worries me. Something is happening - the storm, the rakshasa, the volcano, I do not think it is a coincidence."
