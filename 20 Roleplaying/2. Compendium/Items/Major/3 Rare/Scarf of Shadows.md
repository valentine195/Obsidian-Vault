 # Scarf of Shadows
Held by: [[Mim]]
 
 ### Description
 
 ### Use

**1/rest** - For 10 minutes, you wrap shadows around yourself, making it hard to see you. You gain advantage on stealth checks but suffer disadvantage on charisma checks when speaking to people.

While wrapped in darkness, you can use a portion of the darkness around you to travel between shadows up to a number of times equal to 1 + your proficiency modifier.
