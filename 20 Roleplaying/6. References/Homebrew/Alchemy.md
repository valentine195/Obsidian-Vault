## Alchemy
Alchemy is a crafting art that almost all adventures have some degree of interest in the results of. The source of the ever in demand Healing Potions, it is a versatile trade that fuels (sometimes quite literally) the adventuring life.

It doesn't take many experiences with the powers of potions for an adventure to consider if they can get away with simmering a healing potion next to the stew over that night's cooking fire... of course it's easier said than done for the result of such things to come away not poisonous.

Alchemy tends to be a very quick form of crafting, but with this comes additional risks with most crafts resting on a single roll, and failure resulting in the loss of all materials. Although taking that chance is frequently worth it during a busy adventuring season, consider the "Taking 10" option outlined in the craft introduction when speed is not of the essence.

### Quick Reference
Though the page count may lead one to believe the process is complicated, that comes down to specificity, and largely exists only for reference. The core loop of crafting is quite simple and easy to follow:
* Select a **potion** that you would like to craft from the **"Potions Crafting Table"**.
* Acquire the items listed in the **materials** column for that potion.
* Use your **Alchemy Supplies** tool to craft the potion using the number hours listed in the **Crafting Time** column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting times is 2 hours or less. **Alchemy items must be crafted in a single session.**
* For **every 2 hours**, make a **crafting roll** of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with Alchemy Supplies. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure. 
* On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

### Related Tool & Ability Score
Alchemy works using **Alchemy Supplies**. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any alchemy crafting roll.

Alchemy uses your choice of your **Intelligence** or **Wisdom** modifier.

### Shelf Life & Expired Potions
A unique attribute to alchemy, potions once crafted have a shelf life of 1 year before coming expired. This shelf life is shortened to 1 month if the potion contains any **reactive** ingredient. 

If an expired potion is used or consumed within double its shelf life, roll a d4. On a 1, you become *poisoned* for 1 minute. On a 2 or 3, the potion will work with reduced effect; it's duration will be halved if it had a duration, and damage or healing it dealt with by halved. On a 4, it works as expected.

Any potion that is older than twice its shelf life has no effect besides causing the imbiber to become *poisoned* for 1 minute.

### Crafting Roll
Putting that together means that when you want to work on Alchemy, your crafting roll is as follows:

<div align="center">

**Alchemy Modifier** = your Alchemy Supplies tool proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).

</div>

##### Success and Failure
For Alchemy, after you make the crafting roll and succeed marks your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting item (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Alchemy must be consecutive, meaning that if you wish to continue after a failed craft, you need to extend your crafting time. 

Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.


### Alchemy Saving Throw
Some alchemical creations trigger a saving throw. In instances that they do, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and does not change once it is created.

<div align="center">

**Alchemy DC** = 8 + your Alchemy Supplies tool proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice).

</div>

> ##### Herbalist's Limited Alchemy
> While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature with proficiency with Herbalism Kits has a limited proficiency in creating potions in addition to gathering herbs. You can use proficiency with an Herbalism Kit in place of Alchemy supplies when creating healing potions, antidotes, antitoxins, and potions of poison. 
> 
> When crafting in this way, you use an Herbalism Kit and proficiency with it in place of Alchemy Supplies. This crafting otherwise works the same as using Alchemy Supplies.
>
> You *can* add additional reagent modifiers when crafting in this way.

\pagebreakNum

### Crafting Time
All items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is completed in 2 hour chunk. A crafting roll is made every 2 hours. For each two hours, make a crafting roll. 

On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. 

If you fail **three times in a row**, the crafting is a **failure** and **all materials are lost**.

#### Crafting During a Rest
During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a crafting project if you do nothing else during the long rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a -5 to all Passive Perception checks as you are focused on your craft.

You can make 2 hours of progress on any crafting project by taking this camp action. For most projects, this progress can be banked completing the project 2 hours at a time. For some types of crafting, like alchemy, you cannot make incremental progress, but you can continue for 2 additional hours of crafting before or after a long rest in which you took the camp action "craft" to get 4 hours (for example).

> ##### Camp Actions
> A recommended system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be found [**here**](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MK0g94rlPq9A0KprEKC) and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

### Crafting Rolls
Each profession lists the related ability modifier and tool used to calculate your crafting roll modifier. In many cases, attempting to craft without the applicable tool is impossible. Your DM may allow improvised tools, and in that case the check is made with disadvantage.

Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat source, alchemy requires a heat source. This can range for a laboratory set up to a simple camp fire.

##### Expertise
Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are calculated into your crafting roll modifier, but do **not** add to an the calculated DC the effects of that item have.

##### Temporary Bonuses
A crafting roll is a special type of ability check and you cannot add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic Inspiration or the spell *guidance*) as the crafting roll represents the entire time you spend working the item. 

You can gain can advantage if another player with proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.

\columnbreak

##### Taking 10
When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours to 4 hours per check) to "take a 10" on the crafting roll, meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability score + your related tool proficiency. This provides a floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take your time.

> ##### NPC Crafting
> It should always be assumed that when NPCs are crafting, they take this option, and thus craft more slowly but reliably. The slap-dash speed crafting is largely the domain of the players, though at the DM's discretion the players may convince a NPC to craft faster assuming the risk of their materials.

## Materials
Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting does not make things from thin air, it makes more useful things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally found in three ways.

<div></div>

**Loot & Salvaging**: Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main sources of materials will be the things you find - nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the party.

<div></div>

**Gathered & Harvesting**: How something is gathered varies on the profession - in many cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Harvesting and Gathering rules can be found at the end of the document.

**Purchasing**: Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into you hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any craftsman - money. When you don't have what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.

> ##### Selling and Buying Materials
> 
> In general, the buying price of a material is it's listed value, and its selling price is usually half of that to an interested property. 
>
> Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and DM moods, you may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a party that does not have a use for them, and will only sell to interested parties that can use or resell them.
>
> Threatening to burn down a merchant's shop because they will not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check, but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your reputation - most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily intimidated.

## Types of Meterials

### Reagents

Reagents are huge range of things; most often they are plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.

Reagents are the There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These categories include **curative**, **reactive**, and **poisonous**. These each come in the standard material rarities: **common, uncommon, rare, very rare,** and **legendary.**

Reagents cannot be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).

> ##### Interchangeable Reagents
> All curative, reactive, and poisonous ingredients are interchangeable. This is intentional to drastically simplify the crafting process and tracking thereof. Individual names are included only to deepen the immersion of the finding and buying ingredients, and can be treated as interchangeable by their label if preferred.

### Essences
While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more purified forms of magical power.

These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.


You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.

While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section.

Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.

##### Salvaging Essences
You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete, and does not work if the item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic item is one that recharges or does not have a limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses.

The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.

##### Synthesizing Essences
In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You can combine essences in the following ways:

| Essence | Component Reagents |
|:-------:|:------------------:|
| Arcane  | 1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive | 
| Primal  | 3 reactive |
| Divine  | 2 curative, 1 reactive | 

This process takes 4 hours, and requires alchemy supplies and a heat source.

### Draught of Damnation^K^
*Potion, rare*
This stick red liquid has a living viscosity to it, churning slow within the flask. When you trink this potion, you become a fiend (as if by *shapechanged* for 1 hour). The type of fiend you become is determined by your level. The new form is a random fiend with a Challenge Rating equal to your level, up to a maximum of 10. If there are multople options at that Challenge Rating, roll to determine which option is selected).

When the effect ends and revert to your normal form, you take 1d6 necrotic damage equal to the CR of the fiend who's form you assumed as the toxins of pure evil attempt to destroy your body before relinquishing control of it. If this damage kills you, your soul is dragged to the realm of the fiends by malignant will of the fiend.

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

#### Potion of Flying
*Potion, very rare*
___
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.

#### Potion of Fire Breath
*Potion, uncommon*
___
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. 
This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.

#### Potion of Poison
*Potion, uncommon*
___
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.

#### Bottled Wind^K^
*Concoction, common*

As an action, you can open this casting *gust* without verbal or somatic components. Alternatively, you can breath from it, letting out only a little bit at a time, breathing directly from the bottle, but each time you must make a DC 5 athletics checks. On failure, you cast *gust* as above and all the air is lost. You can get 10 minutes of breathable air from one bottle.

#### Sticky Goo Potion^K^
*Concotion, common*

### Explosives

#### Blasting Powder
*Explosive, common*

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound. 

When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it explodes violently. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 1d4 fire + 1d4 thunder damage, or half as much on a success. The amount of damage increases by 1d4 (both the fire and thunder) and the radius increases by 5 feet for each additional packet of Blasting Powder detonated in the same spot, up to a maximum of five packets. Deals double damage to buildings and structures. Creatures in range of more than one stack of up to 5 explosives at the same time take damage only from the highest damage effect.

> *Frequently used for mining and other responsible things... until adventurers get their hands on it*.

#### Nail Bomb
*Explosive, uncommon*

A brutal instrument, this mixes explosive powder and nails to create a devastating fragmentation device. An exceedingly dangerous device. Heavier and more deadly than other explosives, the primary damage comes from the metal shrapnel (nails) flung in all directions. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually).  When it detonates, all creatures within 20 feet (for common) of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter's Alchemy DC.  On failure, they take 8d4 piercing damage, or half as much on a success.

You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your turn).

#### Dwarven Alcohol
Only dwarves really know if the name of this liquid explosive is a joke or not, but must assume it is an acquired taste. An explosively flammable liquid that comes in a flask, this flask can be splashed across a 5 foot square within 5 feet. Once splashed, it can be ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage it explodes in a plume of fire, dealing 2d4 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the container, or within a square that has been soaked with it.

#### Smoke Powder
*Explosive, common*

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound. 

When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it releases a blast of thick black smoke that fills a 20 foot radius. Everything in this smoke is heavily obscured for 2d4 rounds. At the start of your next turn after the number of rounds rolled, the smoke begins to fade leaving everything within the radius lightly obscured, and it clears completely at the start of your next after that.

Additionally uses of the smoke powder extend the duration of heavy obscurement for an additional 1d4 rounds.

#### Simple/Potent/Powerful Explosive
*Explosive, common/uncommon/rare*

A bundled explosive alchemical preparation. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 10 feet (for common) of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter's Alchemy DC.  On failure, they take 1d8 + 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures in range of more than one explosive take damage only from the highest damage effect.

| Name | Radius | Damage | 
|:------:|:--:|:-----:|:------:|
| Common | 10 feet | 1d8 fire + 1d8 thunder. |
| Potent | 15 feet | 2d8 fire + 2d8 thunder. |
| Powerful | 20 feet | 4d8 fire + 4d8 thunder. | 

You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your turn).

#### Grenade Casing
*Explosive, uncommon*

A simple construction of a two chambered projectile (typically made of glass). When you add an Alchemist Fire and an Explosive to its separate compartments, it becomes an incredibly dangerous device. As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Creatures within the range of the explosive used must make a Dexterity saving throw against the DC of the explosive used, or take damage equal to the explosion + 1d4 piercing damage + 1d4 fire damage.

### Miscellaneous

#### Magical Ink
*Component, common/uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary*
___
Magical ink that is used by Enchanters to create scrolls, made by rendering down magical alchemical ingredients.

### Alchemy Modifiers
The following are alchemical modifiers that can applied to potion. All alchemical modifiers require approval from the DM if the modifier will work with a given potion or creation.

| Modifier      | Difficulty Modifier |  Effect |
|:----------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Aerosol | +8                     | Require two additional reactive reagents of equal rarity to the rarest reagent of the potion. Rather than drinking it, when uncorked or broken (as an action) it effects all creatures in a 5 foot radius as if they'd consumed it. |
| Celestial | +3 | Requires an common divine essence. Adds the effect of *lesser restoration* to the potion. |
| Divine | +6 | Requires an uncommon divine essence. Adds the effect of *greater restoration* to the potion. |
| Endothermic | +4                  | Any fire damage the potion does becomes frost damage | 
| Expansive | +5 | Requires an additional reactive reagent. Expands the area of effect of any area of effect the potion has by 5 feet. | 
| Insidious | +3                   | The effect of the potions becomes shrouded from magic such as *identify*. You can make the potion appear as another potion of the same rarity. Another alchemist can indentify it by making an Alchemy Check against your Alchemy DC  |


### Additional Materials
You can simply load more reagents into any potion, increasing its potency in different ways, though it increases the difficulty. You can make a "custom potion" simply by using these modifiers with no base potion. When you do so, the base DC is 8.

| Additional Reagent | Difficult Modifier | Effect |
|:------------------:|:------------------:|:------:|
| Common Curative    | +2 | The potion restores +1d4 hit points when consumed. |
| Common Reactive    | +2 | The potion deals +1d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed). | 
| Common Poisonous   | +2 | The potion deals +1d4 poison damage when consumed | 
| Uncommon Curative    | +3 | The potion restores +2d4 hit points when consumed. |
| Uncommon Reactive    | +3 | The potion deals +2d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed). | 
| Uncommon Poisonous   | +3 | The potion deals +2d4 poison damage when consumed | 
| Rare Curative    | +4 | The potion restores +3d4 hit points when consumed. |
| Rare Reactive    | +4 | The potion deals +3d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed). | 
| Rare Poisonous   | +4 | The potion deals +3d4 poison damage when consumed | 
| Very Rare Curative    | +5 | The potion restores +4d4 hit points when consumed. |
| Very Rare Reactive    | +5 | The potion deals +4d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed). | 
| Very Rare Poisonous   | +5 | The potion deals +4d4 poison damage when consumed | 
| Legendary Curative    | +6 | The potion restores +5d4 hit points when consumed. |
| Legendary Reactive    | +6 | The potion deals +5d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed). | 
| Legendary Poisonous   | +6 | The potion deals +5d4 poison damage when consumed |

## Harvesting & Looting
Harvesting and looting are two paths to the same place, but generally depend on what kind of foe the enemy has vanquished and is not collecting the stuff of. Typically humanoid creatures that carry stuff are candidates for the Individual Treasure tables, awhile Aberrations, Beasts, Dragons, Monstrosities, and Plants are harvesting candidates.

If you don't normally provide loot equivalent to default treasure tables, you don't need to start providing loot equivalient to them using these new tables, simple apply these tables as frequently as it makes sense for your game.

Remember that you can fully mix and match as it makes sense - you can replace coinage with gems or art pieces, you can replace crafting items that wouldn't make sense with coinage, gems, or art pieces, etc. The tables are merely a guide and convenience for what sort of range of materials should come from what sort of creature.

##### Harvesting
The Harvesting tables replace the Individual Treasure for Aberration, Beast, Dragon, Monstrosity, and Plant type creatures.

##### Remnants 
Remnants optional replace the Individual Treasure table for creatures that leave behind no body on death, like Elementals, Celestials, or Fiends (ones that leave behind a body can use the Harvesting table).

##### Loot
The Loot tables optionally replace the Individual Treasure for Humanoid type creatures - you can use this table in all cases or in some cases.

> ##### Recommendation
> I would recommend using the table for all humanoid enemies, but using the equivalent gold value for roughly half of enemies to keep gold flowing into the PCs pockets while also providing abundant crafting supplies.

##### Hoards
Rather than replacing the hoard tables, simple use the default hoard table and replace an amount of coins, gems, and art pieces with crafting materials. This ensures that players are still getting the sort of loot the expect, but also fills in new materials into things that would often fill little role beside being converted to coinage at a later date.

### Basic Harvesting
Beasts, Dragons, and Monstrosities can be harvested using **Wisdom (Survival)** for meat and hides. As a DMs discretion, a Plant type creature can be harvested for food using the same DC and amount, but providing *common fresh ingredients* instead of meat.

\columnbreak

### Exotic Creature Harvesting

*Applicable Targets: Aberration, Constructs, Dragons, Monstrosities, Plants, Some Undead*

A random roll is performed to judge what can be harvested from the monster. For **Dragons and Monstrousities**, a **Wisdom (Medicine)** check is required to harvest the material without destroying it, for **Constructs**, an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check is required, and for **Plants** an **Intelligence (Nature)** check is required.

If a beast is sufficiently magical, poisonous, or vemous, a DM can opt to use the Dragon & Monstrosity table for exotic harvesting, but this should be rare - even a poisonous beast is usually too mundane for the magical properties of harvested materials, and a beast should always be rolled on the 0-4 CR table regardess of its CR.

At a DMs discretion, some Undead may be harvested as well if there is something that would make sense for them provide in this manner, in which case the would use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. Undead are less likely to provide anything of use, simply having a rare chance of providing arcane essences, though some would consider the use of these essences evil.

> ##### Double Harvesting
> If a monster is applicable for both Basic Harvesting and Exotic Harvesting, you can perform both, but the second check rolled has disadvantage on the skill check to successfully gather the materials.

### Exotic Remnants

*Applicable Targets: Celestials, Elementals, Fiends, Some Undead*

Some creatures typically do not leave behind corpses. While these most often disappear without a trace, sometimes they will leave behind a fragment of the magical forces that powered them as a remnant, in the form of a reagent or essence. These are less likely to result in a crafting item, but don't require any check to gather it successfully.

> ##### Applying Material Tables
> As a DM, never feel compelled to roll on a table if you feel it makes sense to do something else. The tables provide a baseline, but if you feel that it makes sense of a given monster to leave behind a given material, simply do so, requiring the check that seems most appropriate (using the tables as a guide if you wish).

## Gathering Tables
Many of the materials can simply be found growing in the wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to look for and spends the time doing just that. When traveling at a slow pace through wilderness for 8 hours or more (i.e. not urban land or farmland) you can make a gathering check, but have disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.

If you dedicate 8 hours to gathering without traveling, you can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item other than an essence of their choice that is available within 

that biomes table, (making the skill check from the corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any trivial time (making a DC 8 skill check to harvest it)

The found items then have to be gathered. You can choose to gather reagents, search for materials, or hunt wild game. Roll a d100 and consult the corresponding table below for the relevant biome to determine what is found.

##### Gather Reagents
Reagents are harvested with making a Wisdom ability check. If have an **Herbalism** kit and are proficient with it, you can add your proficiency modifier to the roll.
