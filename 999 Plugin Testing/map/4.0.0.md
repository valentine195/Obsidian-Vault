Hello everyone! Obsidian Leaflet just received a **massive** new update, bringing it to version 4.0.0.

Highlights:

1. The *entire* plugin has been rewritten, resulting in a much faster and smoother experience.
2. Images are loaded in a background process and no longer block Obsidian from responding.
3. You can now view detailed health data on the map, including elevation, pace, cadence and more!
4. There is a brand-new Leaflet Map View. You can save parameters for your in-note maps to the view to open an exact copy, or create your own, custom view.
5. You can now draw and edit shapes directly on maps!
6. For those of you using Obsidian to run TTRPGs, Leaflet now integrates directly with the Initiative Tracker, giving you the ability to use it as a full-on battlemap.
7. You can now specify alternate map serves other than OpenStreetMap, and real-world maps can now have multiple layers.
8. The plugin now has full localization support (but currently only supports English).

**Note: As with any large update, there could be bugs. Please report anything you see on the Github repo.**
