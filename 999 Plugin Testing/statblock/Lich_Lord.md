>> ## Description
>> The casual observer might be forgiven for mistaking a Lich for some form of Skeleton or Skeleton Lord. Indeed, the Lich has a skeletal form of ivory bones but in its eyeless sockets burn blood red sparks which blaze when the Lich is enraged. Unlike the Skeleton Lord, the Lich is dressed in full-length robes and bears the paraphernalia of a master wizard or archmage, such as enchanted blades and rings, wands or staves of power. Even without using its Undead Fear or its Chill, a Lich has a palpable presence and a commanding demeanor.
>>
>> ### Lifestyle
>> Whilst alive, the Lich would have been among the foremost practitioners of the magical arts. Transformation into the undead existence of a Lich was the wizard&#x27;s choice of means to avoid death and acquire immortality (of sorts), yet retaining all their powers and skills. As there are other magical ways of becoming immortal, Liches are almost invariably evil. Whatever agendas the Lich pursued in life, it will now pursue in an even grander fashion in undeath, magnifying its desires for power (political or magical) and arcane knowledge, and amplifying its arrogance, ruthlessness and cruelty. The Lich prefers to rule from its stronghold, relying mostly on mundane and eldritch retainers to implement its wishes beyond. The need to protect its life casket teaches the Lich caution, even justified paranoia, just as the casket constrains the Lich to remain in its vicinity.
>>
>> ### Background
>> Once a Lich would have been a mortal practitioner of magic, but one who was unwilling to face death and be judged for their actions and inactions in this life.
Through long study, arduous research and potentially bargains with otherworldly demonic and diabolical entities, the would-be Lich gained the secrets of a desperate and despicable greater ritual. Through their willing execution of the necromantic Ritual of Black Eternity, the living sorcerer is transformed into a Lich, sacrificing their human flesh and blood for the undying form of the Lich, and committing their once vital organs to the safety of their prepared life casket.
>>
>> ### Adventure Notes
>> Masters of magic with few rivals to challenge them, storming the fortress of a Lich to raid its vast magical treasury of centuries of accumulated items is an epic undertaking even for the most experienced heroes.
The might of the Lich or the Lich Lord makes it a fitting ultimate villain or evil spell user for a campaign. The influence of the Lich may be overt through its direct political control over a region or more subtle for a Lich interested solely in magical matters.
Adventurers may be drawn into conflict with the agents of a Lich as they seek to unravel its conspiracies and foil its long-range and long-term plans. As adventurers become enmeshed in this struggle, they must expect to contend with still deadlier adversaries at each step. If they survive all these challenges, then they may have an opportunity to confront the Lich directly.
A Lich must have a secure location for its base of operations, its magical researches and its life casket. For its stronghold, the Lich may acquire or build a tower or castle aboveground or fashion a subterranean citadel. The Lich will use all its ingenuity and the expertise of others to make its stronghold as impregnable as possible, employing traps, secret passages, guardians and more to protect itself and its life casket. If its life casket is destroyed, then the Lich can be permanently destroyed, so every Lich guards its casket more than itself and has a plan and the means to relocate it.

>>> The process of becoming a Lich adds new abilities and a weakness, replaces some existing powers, and eliminates old capabilities. This is represented by applying the Lich Overlay to an existing creature or being.
Liches are categorised into Class by their original level before transformation - those who were up to 50th level are Class V (Lich); those greater than 50th level are Class VI (Lich Lord). A Lich will normally be a minimum of 25th level.
As in life, so in undeath, Liches are rarely expert in weapon skills and have little desire for close quarters combat. They rely on the magical wards and traps of their fortresses and the martial skills of their vassals and henchmen. A Lich escort may include mortal warriors, lesser undead, demons, or artificial entities.
A Lich without escort will frequently possess the magic to conjure subservient demons or monsters to aid its defense. A Lich will deploy its knowledge of the magical arts and its arsenal of sorcerous devices with devastating effect. To a Lich, there is no such concept as overkill.

### Weaknesses
Shackle (Life Casket): the transformation process to Lichdom involves the magical removal of the Lich&#x27;s organs which are placed in a sealed casket. As long as the casket&#x27;s contents are safe, then a Lich cannot be permanently destroyed - even if it receives a &quot;Dust&quot; result on a Turn Undead or similar magic, its body will reform near the life casket (in 1-10 days if a Lich, 1-10 hours if a Lich Lord). If the casket&#x27;s contents are destroyed, then the lich can be permanently killed (or stay destroyed if already killed). Liches must remain within the vicinity of their life casket (2 miles per level for a Lich; 5 miles per level for a Lich Lord) and cannot move it themselves by mundane or magical means, but can have other beings move it on their behalf.
