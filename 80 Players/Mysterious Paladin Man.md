#### Backstory

The son of a well known leader from his homeland. Despite the fame and adoration his father eventually garnered, he never aligned with nor desired these affirmations or a position of leadership. In fact, he rather looked up to his uncle, a famous character in his own right, but certainly not the type to be participatory in any conventional establishment. It's not that his father was a bad man... or good one for that matter. In fact, the misgivings of dissidents and praises of acolvtes alike would likely hold equal legitimacy to any neutral observer. Alas, what drew the Mysterious Outlander to the ways of his uncle was his devout commitment to a nobler cause devotion to unsullied goodness and a devout disdain for evil. The outlander's uncle operated under a code, one without faction or ministry. Paradoxically, many officials and even the gods themselves considered The Outlander's uncle to be a lawless man, but The Outlander understood more clearly. His uncle was not beholden to the laws of man nor god, he was beholden to the universal truth of goodness itself (Perhaps what The Outlander did not realize, at least not yet, was that his uncle may have been bound to something... or someone, an ancient thing). Sometimes this truth does attempt to evince itself to The Outlander, but only briefly, and only on the very edges of the plane of dreams in the for of an echo or maybe a wisp of smoke.

It's there only for a moment before fading away and obscuring itself once more, leaving The Outlander no less certain of his righteous endeavors.

The Outlander's desire to distance himself from his father's high status ultimately proved irrelevant. One day, something strange appeared on the horizon of his homeland. At first, many thought it to be some new technology or maybe a manifestation of their ruler's magic. The object sat on the horizon motionless for enough time that its mystery waned and inhabitants started to accustom to its presence. It was then that the reality of the object's intentions struck. The invasion came swiftly and absolutely. Nothing remained of The Outlander's home, his father and uncle victims to the brutality of war. In the chaos The Outlander's devoutness to his uncle's indoctrination was further solidified. War brought all manner of evil, even from those whom The Outlander expected otherwise. Nothing was more important now than the Cause of Goodness.

When The Outlander awoke his city was gone, his family was gone, but in his right hand a sword-his uncle's sword. He cannot remember what happened or how he survived, only that he was alone.

Now, after a long, tiresome journey, The Outlander has found a new city. For a time he stays on the outskirts providing healing and aid to ill, wounded, or accosted travelers. For him, the city holds three principal dangers. Firstly, he fears being recognized, given his father's profile, even though he is far from home. Secondly, perhaps the enemies who destroyed his homeland lurk within the city walls. Finally, as The Outlander learned in several precarious incidents, is that the Riedrans are particularly hostile, and have threatened his life on multiple occasions.

Despite all of The Outlander's intentions to remain anonymous and solitary, the allure of companionship draws him toward the city, landing him in a dire situation that he just might not be able to escape this time.
