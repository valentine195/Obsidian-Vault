# Session

## Ideas
[[Agathax]] leads them back to the guesthouse and inside
- dragon??
- [[Pust]]??
- what is happening at the volcano?
- ==Agathax asks about Jeremiah's armor==
- Agathax should tell them to flee

## Strong Start

> [!dnd]
> 
> Agathax leads the four of you, plus her bodyguard, back inside the guest house. The bodyguard leans against the wall and goes still, becoming hard to focus on without concentration. She takes in the destruction from the fighting, then steps around the debris to set in a lounge chair.
> 
> She gestures at the chairs around her.
