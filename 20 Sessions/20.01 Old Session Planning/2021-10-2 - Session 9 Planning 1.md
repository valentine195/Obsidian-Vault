## Characters

```dataview
list from #pc/alive 
```

## Strong Start

- bob is on the way to a balcony but noticed a lizardman following him
- the rest of the group is looking out at the erupting volcano while speaking to drox

> Drox stands at the balcony, silhoutted against the erupting volcano far to the east. The storm around the volcano has begun moving towards the great tree, and as night falls you can see the lightning streaking through the towering clouds.
> [!quote] [[Drox]]
> Jeremiah Silver Flame, I intend to lead the combined might of the clans against the Blackscales at [[Haka'Torvhak]]. The clanmeet tomorrow night is pivotal. Will you lend the might of the Flame to my cause, as we once lent our might to yours?

#### Cut to Bob after discussion

> Bob, you have just noticed a gray-scaled lizardman that has been following you as you make your way up to the balcony. You saw him claw hook into the trees above the platform.

> Roll an attack roll against Bob (+5 to hit)
> 
> **Lizardfolk Monk**
> 
> Suddenly, a claw hook flies out the trees heading right at you.

## Scenes

### 1. Agathax the Shaman

> The rest of you hear a soft knock on the door. Yoss opens it and a towering, hugely muscled lizardman walks in, followed by an ancient, shriveled lizardwoman, supported by a cane. Both of the newcomers are covered head to toe in intricate tattoos, and the bodyguard is wearing a [[Warder's Cloak|shimmering rainbow cloak]] that changes colors as you look at it, making it hard to focus on him. He leans against the wall and seems to fade out of sight. Drox bows and says, "Jeremiah and others, this is our clan high witch, [[Agathax]]. To what do we owe this honor?"


> The witch holds out her hand and the Coin of Dust Bob was carrying floats out of it, hovering in the air between all of you. Over the jungle, the storm from the volcano 
> 
> "Where is the one that held this?"

> 
> **If the Check Was Close**
> 
> You try to dodge out of the way but the hook scrapes you as it slides by and buries itself in the platform behind you.
> 
> **If the Check wasn't Close**

> 
> And you take `dice: 1d6 + 3` damage.

- "This coin... it has left a filth on you"
- The three ancient lizard women sit in a circle facing the middle of the hut, and [[Chiax]] gestures for you to sit in the middle of them.
- All three begin chanting in unison, and dozens of candles flare to life around the edge of the hut with a bright green flame that casts flickering shadows as a wind begins to blow.
- She shudders, then draws a deep, ragged breath and looks up with empty eyes that slowly turn black. She stares through you, unseeing, then throws her head back:
	
	> _THE LADY OF DEATH, BLIND TO HER SHROUD OF DUST
	> WORKS TO UNDO HER TERRIBLE CURSE
	> BUT IN DOING SO, SHE WILL
	> THE WORLD WILL MOURN
	> AS IT DID WITH YOUR FATHER'S DEATH_
