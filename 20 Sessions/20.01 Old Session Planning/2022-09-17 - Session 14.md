## Strong Start

> [!map]+
> ![[Newthrone#Map]]


> [!recite] 
> The stone goes cool in your hand, Bob, as you hear the little orphan child tell Everest Lindsay that they saw you in the streets. The street outside the alley is bustling, and you can hear the sounds of a street market nearby. An orphan boy across from the alley entrance is still calling a story, yelling "House Tharashk puts bounty on Heroes! Ten thousand gold for word of the Heroes of Whitecliff!", and a large crowd is gathering around him, grabbing flyers sitting at his feet.
>
> Mim, from your trips here in the Gray Tide, you remember that there is a tavern nearby where people mind their own business and makes a good place to talk.

> [!dnd]
> You can see the Newthrone Gazette marquee rising up above the city to your east, and to your west the sky swarms with air ships above the Newthrone Wind Harbor. The Tharashk ship floats in the air, still smoking out of a large hole in the hull, listing hard.

## Scenes

### Inspired Bullies at Raymond's Respite


> [!important] An Inspired is peeking in the tavern!

> [!dnd]
> The interior of the tavern is dimly lit and looks pretty much the same as you remember, Mim. There are a handful of patrons sitting about as far away from each other as possible - two orcs lean close together mumbling something in Orcish, a shifter in the corner is staring into his beer, a kalashtar sits at the bar with a few scattered humans, while the bartender leans against the wall, drying a glass.
> 
> No one looks up as you enter, not even the bartender, 

> [!encounter]-
> ```encounter
> creatures:
> - 4: Inspired
> ```

> [!dnd]
> The door to the tavern suddenly slams against the wall as its thrown open. Three of **literally** the most beautiful people you have ever seen walk into the tavern, each shirtless but wearing long, flowing pants, and each have a greatsword on one hip and two daggers on the other.
>
> The bartender finally looks up from the glass he's been cleaning over and over, pulls out a crossbow and says, "You Riedrans aren't welcome here." One of the Riedrans flicks his hand and the bartender goes completely still.
>
> {Raspy voice} "Don't worry... we're just here for the mutant.", pointing to the Kalashtar.

### Confronted by Tharashk



### The Newthrone Gazette

![[Newthrone Gazette#Notable Members]]

> [!dnd]
> The Newthrone Gazette marquee rises high above the rest of the city and is extremely bright. The sign dwarfs the actual building, which is a plain 2-story brick house barely squeezed into an alley between two much taller buildings.
>
> A constant stream of newsboys are going in and out, carrying newspapers out to distribute. A cryer is standing on the second floor balcony with a magically amplified voice, crying out the latest headline: *"Tharashk Accuses Heroes of Attack on Airship; Offers no evidence"*

> [!dnd]
> The inside of the building is chaos. You can barely make out three desks underneath stacks and stacks of paper; a handful of what you presume are junior reporters are walking between the stacks, notebooks in hand, shouting stories and leads to each other. They briefly stop and gawk at Jeremiah for a few seconds before getting back into their groove, completely dismissing your group.
>
> A printing press is visible in a room separated from the main space by glass, churning out newspapers that are quickly being cut and distributed to waiting newsboys.
> 
> The reporter that interviewed you in Whitecliff sits behind one of the three desks and his eyes light up when he finally notices you. "Well, well, well, if it ain't the Heroes of Whitecliff. You've made quite a mess of things, haven't you?" 
> **MAKE A PERCEPTION CHECK** -> DC 15 to notice Astrid quietly slip out the back

> [!quote] Harvey
> "Sharn, eh. It's your lucky day. The Race of the Eight winds is coming up, and I was flying out to Sharn tomorrow." He glances at Jeremiah and says, "Lots of extra weight to carry on an airship, though. What's in it for me?"
