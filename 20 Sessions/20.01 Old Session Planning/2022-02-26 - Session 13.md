## Strong Start

> [!recite]
>
> The four of you stand in front of your boat, which has been pulled up on the bank slightly in a small inlet off the river. Pust has just vanished into the forest, leaving you alone. The mid-afternoon sky is filled with smoke and ash from the clan tree, but your immediate surroundings are eerily silent, broken only by the sound of the river rushing past and the dragon roars that still echo throughout the jungle. It has been about 2 days since Jasper was kidnapped and you left for Newthrone, and based on what Agathax told you, Newthrone is only about half a day's journey downriver.

## Scenes

### ENTER NEWTHRONE

[[Newthrone]]

> [!map]-
> ![[Newthrone#Map]]

> [!recite]
>
> The river curves gently to the south, then suddenly the trees open up and, finally, Newthrone lies a few miles ahead of you. The river curves to the west just before the city and flows along the northern end of the city. Airships swarm the skies, a chaotic stream of ships moving to and from the flying docks. One airship in particular stands out - it seems to barely be able to float, listing hard to one side at its dock, and has significant fire damage.
>
> Immediately the four of you notice the Newthrone Gazette marquee rising high above most of the buildings, and its extremely bright lights continuously flash in a random pattern, noticeable even in the middle of the afternoon. Newthrone Castle is visible behind the marquee
>
> Mim, you remember that the only harbor for the city is just past the Bleakbridge, nearer to the sea. You also remember that the harbor tends to be just as chaotic as the skies, with ships of all sizes constantly moving a round the river.

**Jeremiah, you tower over everyone here in the city. **

> [!recite]
>
> A mob of children are running around the streets here, at least 20 of them playing some sort of game. One of them suddenly stops and points at the four of you and yells, "Look! Look! That must be one of the Heroes!" and suddenly they swarm you, all clamoring for attention. It's chaos around you, as several try to climb both Jeremiah and Dinodas, a few start poking at Ghoulie, and some of the girls start asking Mim and Merigold what adventuring is like.
>

>
> Bob, one of the kids asks you if you built Ghoulie.
>
> He looks super impressed, then immediately asks you if you really killed Ven Leser d'Tharashk.
>
> "Well, all the newspapers say so."
> "Did you really crash the airship?"
> "I heard Everest Lindsay is going to kill you all" "I think they could take him" "Everest is gonna send an Inquisitor after them! They won't stand a chance"

> [!recite]
>
> A newsboy stands on the corner with a stack of newspapers at his feet, screaming at the top of his lungs: "Heroes Kill Tharashk Heir, Crash Airship! Read all about it, folks! Newthrone Gazette, only five copper! What happened to the volcano? Only in the Newthrone Gazette!" He sees the four

> [!important]
> Airship (2 days - **300g/person**) OR regular ship (10 days, **10g/person**), Pirates either way
