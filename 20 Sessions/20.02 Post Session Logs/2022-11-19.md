The party began interrogating the new mysterious Kalashtar man; Goldie and Mim (because she was charmed) advocated for him, and they took him with them to the Gazette.

On the way to the gazette, it felt like eyes were on them and people were watching them the whole way. They made it to the building without incident, though, and entered. Harvey (the one who interviewed them) saw and quickly recognized Bob as a Hero of Whitecliff, but they were able to convince him he wasn't, and that they could help him out with getting his airship free of the Tharask blockade.

They revealed themselves as the Heroes and Harvey gave them two options - they could try to get to the airship and outrun the blockade, or they could cause a distraction by destroying an armor depot nearby.

Bob and Jeremiah didn't trust Harvey so they went with him to wait at the airship. Mim, Goldie and Nameless went to the armory and tried to walk in the door, where they were attacked by flesh golems. Goldie used a crane to lift Mim up to an open window, where she snuck in, grabbed a set of keys, opened the door to the explosive room, stole a grenade and blew it sky high. She was able to grab Nameless' whip and be pulled out of the armory as it went up in flames. The Tharashk airships began landing as hordes of guards ran towards the armory.
