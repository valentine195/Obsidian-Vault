The group started the session entering the guesthouse in the Cold Sun Clanhold. Yoss warned you that blood feuds would be settled during the night. Exploring the house, they noticed the view from the balcony overlooked the jungle to the east, where the could see a massive volcano spewing smoke into the air, surrounded by dark black storm clouds. As they watched, they felt a rumble shake the tree, then saw the volcano erupt, spewing lava high into the air.

Bob began trying to calculate the distance to the volcano, but was struggling to pinpoint it through the haze and smoke. Soon after, Drox entered the room followed by four lizardfolk carrying a massive, dark grey wooden chest. He told the group that the chest had been left there by the first Silver Flame Templar, Tira Moran, and asked them to hold onto it until "the return". He considered Jeremiah the rightful owner of the chest and handed over to him. Inside was the Longsword of Verdict, a pair of simple leather gauntlets trimmed with silver inlayed with gold, and a large amount of ancient Galifarian gold coins.

Bob went outside to try to get a better view of the volcano, and a random passerby noticed him looking out at it and told him he could get a better look from the overlook at the top of the tree. He began climbing the steps when another rumble shook the tree, harder this time. After a few flights of stairs, he noticed a lizardfolk clawhook into the treetop above him and realized he was being followed - by the person that told him to go to the top of the tree.
