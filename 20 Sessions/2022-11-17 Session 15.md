### Confronted by Tharashk

### The Newthrone Gazette

![[Newthrone Gazette#Notable Members]]

> [!dnd]
> The Newthrone Gazette marquee rises high above the rest of the city and is extremely bright. The sign dwarfs the actual building, which is a plain 2-story brick house barely squeezed into an alley between two much taller buildings.
>
> A constant stream of newsboys are going in and out, carrying newspapers out to distribute. A cryer is standing on the second floor balcony with a magically amplified voice, crying out the latest headline: _"Tharashk Accuses Heroes of Attack on Airship; Offers no evidence"_

> [!dnd]
> The inside of the building is chaos. You can barely make out three desks underneath stacks and stacks of paper; a handful of young reporters are running between the stacks, notebooks in hand, shouting stories and leads to each other. They briefly stop and gawk at Jeremiah for a few seconds before getting back into their groove, completely dismissing your group.
> A set of stairs leads up to a small landing. 
>
> Only two of the desks are occupied - one by a tall elven woman intent on a typewriter and another by Harvey, the reporter that interviewed you in Whitecliff. His eyes light up when he sees you. "Well, well, well. You've made quite a mess of things, haven't you?" Then he glances over at the elf, who seems to be absorbed in her story. He leans in and says, “listen, let’s just go up to my office to talk, eh? Just stay quiet and try to stay out of the way.”

> **MAKE A PERCEPTION CHECK** -> DC 15 to notice Astrid quietly slip out the back

> [!quote] Harvey
> "Sharn, eh. I think we can help each other out. Tharashk has been a thorn in my side since I did your interview, and now they have our airship blockaded. “
>
> “Ways I see it, we got two options. We go into the air dock guns blazing and hope to outrun the fastest ship in the sky, or we create a little diversion to get Tharashk off our backs.”
