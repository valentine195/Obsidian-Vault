### The Newthrone Gazette

![[Newthrone Gazette#Notable Members]]

> [!dnd]
> The Newthrone Gazette marquee rises high above the rest of the city and is extremely bright. The sign dwarfs the actual building, which is a plain 2-story brick house barely squeezed into an alley between two much taller buildings.
>
> A constant stream of newsboys are going in and out, carrying newspapers out to distribute. A cryer is standing on the second floor balcony with a magically amplified voice, crying out the latest headline: _"Tharashk Accuses Heroes of Attack on Airship; Offers no evidence"_

> [!dnd]
> The inside of the building is chaos. You can barely make out three desks underneath stacks and stacks of paper; a handful of young reporters are running between the stacks, notebooks in hand, shouting stories and leads to each other. They briefly stop and gawk at Jeremiah for a few seconds before getting back into their groove, completely dismissing your group.
>
> A printing press is visible in a room separated from the main space by glass, churning out newspapers that are quickly being cut and distributed to waiting newsboys.
>
> Only two of the desks are occupied - one by a tall elven woman intent on a typewriter and another by Harvey, the reporter that interviewed you in Whitecliff. His eyes light up when he sees you. "Well, well, well. You've made quite a mess of things, haven't you?" Then he glances over at the elf, who is absorbed in her story. “Let’s go up to my office to talk, eh? Just stay quiet and try to stay out of the way, please.”

> **MAKE A PERCEPTION CHECK** -> DC 15 to notice Astrid quietly slip out the back

> [!quote] Harvey
> "Sharn, eh. It's your lucky day. The Race of the Eight winds is coming up, and I was planning on flying out to Sharn tomorrow. We have a small problem, though. Tharashk ain’t letting anyone leave the city without some, ahem, *thorough* inspections.”
