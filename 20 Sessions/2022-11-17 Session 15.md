## Strong Start

As you fly away in the wooden airship, you look back and see that the partially damaged wooden airship is still in pursuit. Harvey quickly adjusts the dials on the dashboard to increase your speed, desperate to stay ahead. The ship creaks beneath you as it accelerates and hear the wind whistle around it as you soar through the sky. You hear the keening sound of the Tharashk airship and, glancing back, you see that it is gaining on you.

Harvey adjusts the dials again and the ship starts trembling; "Shit. That isn't good." He slows the ship until the trembling stops and glances back at your pursuers. "Shit. Shit. This isn't good at all. Okay. What are we going to do?"

## Conclusion

## Scenes

### Confronted by Tharashk

### The Newthrone Gazette

![[Newthrone Gazette#Notable Members]]

> [!dnd]
> The Newthrone Gazette marquee rises high above the rest of the city and is extremely bright. The sign dwarfs the actual building, which is a plain 2-story brick house barely squeezed into an alley between two much taller buildings.
>
> A constant stream of newsboys are going in and out, carrying newspapers out to distribute. A cryer is standing on the second floor balcony with a magically amplified voice, crying out the latest headline: _"Tharashk Accuses Heroes of Attack on Airship; Offers no evidence"_

> [!dnd]
> The inside of the building is chaos. You can barely make out three desks underneath stacks and stacks of paper; a handful of young reporters are running between the stacks, notebooks in hand, shouting stories and leads to each other. They briefly stop and gawk at Jeremiah for a few seconds before getting back into their groove, completely dismissing your group.
> A set of stairs leads up to a small landing. 
>
> Only two of the desks are occupied - one by a tall elven woman intent on a typewriter and another by Harvey, the reporter that interviewed you in Whitecliff. His eyes light up when he sees you. "Well, well, well. You've made quite a mess of things, haven't you?" He glances over at the elf, who seems to be absorbed in her story. He leans in and quietly says, “listen, let’s just go up to my office to talk, eh? Just stay quiet and try to stay out of the way.”

> **MAKE A PERCEPTION CHECK** -> DC 15 to notice Astrid quietly slip out the back

> [!quote] Harvey
> "Sharn, eh. I think we can help each other out. Tharashk has been a thorn in my side since I did your interview, and now they have our airship blockaded. “
>
> “Way I see it, we got two options. We go into the air dock guns blazing and hope to outrun the fastest ships in the sky, or we create a little... diversion... to get Tharashk off our backs.”

> “Tharashk has a little armory depot in the city and a good source tells me there’s quite a few illegal explosives inside locked up tight.  We blow it sky high and we can slip out in the chaos.”

## Secrets and Clues

## Fantastic Locations

### Tharashk Armor Depot

- Random cult fanatics are working in the depot, mostly can be snuck up on

> [!dnd]
> The warehouse is a basic, rectangular building. There are windows near the roof line and almost all of them have been propped open, but they're at least 40 feet off the ground. Above the eastern side of the building rises a crane where presumably goods are loaded and unloaded from ships in the dock. A single door sits at the southern end of the western wall with a guard booth posted outside of it, where you can just make out the silhouettes of two creatures.

```encounter
name: Guard Booth
creatures:
- 2: Flesh Golem
```

> [!dnd]
> The warehouse is mostly open; rows and rows of just about every basic weapon fill the main space, organized by type. A manual crane on tracks is on the ceiling, and in the middle of the eastern back wall is a large door where train tracks enter the building. You can see a handful of guards mulling around the building, mostly lounging around. A few are patrolling the rows with lanterns. At the north end of the building is a large reinforced door, and next to it is a windowless room that has been built out.

- A *large* cache of explosives is stored in the back room, behind a fortified locked door
	- The door is a large, heavy-looking wooden door with iron banding running across it. 
	- There is a set of 2 locks on the door that has a mechanism connecting the two together. A plate next to the door has the word "WARNING" and the symbol for death on it.
- The fanatics will immediately break a vessel containing a shadow demon when they enter


> [!dnd]
> The door opens into a large room, maybe 25ft x 30ft, filled with bags of black powder. A worktable against the back wall has a handful of finished grenades on it, and two Tharashk workers are currently filling more grenades. Two workers are playing cards at a break table in the corner, and look up when the door opens. "Shit!" one yells, and starts fumbling in his pack for something. Roll initiative!
