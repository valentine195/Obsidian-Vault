_**OLD**_

_**USE FORCEFIELD TO SEPARATE GROUP FROM JASPER**_

> The cave opens up into a large cavern, with steps carved into a slope towards a beautiful temple. A dark red light is flickering inside the temple, almost like the glow of a dark bonfire. As you get closer you realize the flickering is the shadows from something moving around in front of the light. The red light becomes more and more intense as you head up the stairs towards the light, but now that you're close to the doors you can see a number 1 glowing faintly above the door. Suddenly the light flashes a bright red and you hear a voice cry out in pain. Jasper looks at you in surprise and says, "I think that's Quinn up ahead. I'm gonna skin that two-bit backstabber alive" and he darts ahead, through the open doors, as the number above them swirls into a 0 and a shimmering force field appears.

> It is hard to make out much detail in the room opening up ahead of you, but you can see two people standing about 25 feet away at the far end of the cavern, inspecting something emitting the light sitting on an ornately carved dias. They do not appear to have noticed you yet, and you hear one say:
>
> "So the Shaper's prophecy was correct. Try to remove it."
> The taller of the two moves forward and reaches a hand out towards the dias, and when he touches whatever is on it, you hear a loud SNAP and the light flares. You recognize the man to be Quinn, and he is thrown to the ground. The other appears to be a teenage girl.*

- When party is noticed by Erandis:
  > "The girl turns to face you and, as she does, great skeletal wings unfurl from her back. When her gaze falls on you, you feel immense power rolling off of her in waves, and you feel that power worming its way into your mind, trying to force you to be still."
- @"Erandis Vol" casts Hold Person (Wis DC 23) on the party. If anyone resists the spell:
  > The girl quirks her head at you, and you hear an ancient voice say, "Ah, impressive. A creature of will. Do not resist me, mortal, or you will feel my full wrath."

> _She walks up to your group, and as she gets closer, you realize she is undead - half her face is just a skull and her wings are little more than bone. She has elven features but her remaining skin is scaled, not smooth, and it glitters in the dark red light. A large, partial dragonmark, one none of you have ever seen but clearly a Siberys mark, is visible on the side of her face still covered with skin, but it was ripped in half with her face.  She walks around each of you, inspecting you._
>
> "This is who the Chamber sent to stop me? Two forged ones and a changeling? After all these years...the disrespect."

> Whoever has the bag: "My, my. A bag of holding. Where did the likes of you get this?" She slips it off of you and onto her shoulder. "This shall come in handy. The prophecy is proving correct, indeed."

> Mim, when she gets to you, she stops and stares at you with her one remaining eye, her other a dark void in her skull. "Hmm. A changeling. I'll need to have a little chat with Kel. I told him to rein you in."

> Jeremiah, she sees your new shield and smirks. "I'm surprised the Flame is working with the Chamber. Very interesting." She touches your shield with a finger bone, and it begins to sizzle. Her eyes widen slightly, then narrow. "It ripped you in half. But least it gave you a trinket for your troubles."

> Bob. "Another, hmm? But you...you are different. I can feel the mark of your maker upon you. I respected him, until the end. He gave you a great gift, child. But oh, how you squander it."

> Jasper: "Ah, and you are the one the prophecy speaks of. Your life will be given in service of forces far greater than you, mortal." _**Jasper looks shocked and confused, and the girl grabs them and puts them across her shoulder.**_

> - The girl walks back to the dias, where you see Quinn now writhing on the ground. She slips the bag of holding around the source of the light on the dias, and when she does you see it is a huge dragonshard, far larger than any you've seen before. The bag closes and the light is gone, plunging the cavern into darkness. You feel your magical bonds release you as a portal opens near the dias, brightening the room briefly before it quickly winks out. The room is plunged into complete darkness, until you see two glowing red eyes open where you saw Quinn's body.
