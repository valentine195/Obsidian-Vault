## Intro

I thought I'd do a bit of a twist on the classic fighting pits/gladiator arena trope (because my players and I love it to bits), attempting to follow the incredible Brennan Lee Mulligan's encounter design philosophy. The plan is to incorporate timed elements, environmental hazards, verticality of movement, and non-combat tasks. This is built for my group of 4 PCs who I'll be splitting into 2 teams, each of whom will fight 2 seasoned fighters who are familiar with the Pits. These can also be used for 4-on-1 gladiator fights against high-CR monsters, or adapted to work with whatever group you're DM-ing for!

Feel free to give me some feedback in the comments. They're not all meant to be perfectly balanced with one another, hence the element of randomness, but I'm keen to hone all this as much as possible!

## The Fighting Pits

The Fighting Pits' arena is 125ft long and 60ft wide with a 5ft gap bisecting it into 60ft squares. It is recessed 15ft into the floor and surrounded by enough rows of raked seats to fit 500. The arena's walls are made of polished stone and a magic shell surrounds it to prevent escape by any of the combatants. Six large doorways lead into the arena, two on each of its longer sides and one on each of its shorter ends.

The Pits are rigged with an enormous pulley system which rotates platforms between 6 options. When simultaneous fights occur, huge pikes rise from the gap splitting the two halves of the field, preventing interference between the separate fights. When there is only one fight, using the entire arena, combatants can fall (on a failed DC10 athletics or acrobatics check) or be pushed into the gap, falling 5ft on to the top of the pikes and taking 1d10 piercing damage.

All combatants have any magic items taken from them before they fight in the Pits. At each entrance to the arena, there are armouries equipped with non-magical versions of every kind of weapon imaginable. The ogres (or Hill Giants if you’d rather) that man the pulley system stand near the entrance to the arena and can give basic advice to new contestants, giving them clues about environmental hazards, their enemies’ weaknesses etc.

There are two enormous wheels up against one of the walls behind the seats. One wheel is labelled “Terrain”, the other “Incentives”. Each wheel is spun once to determine what the conditions will be in the arena. If two simultaneous fights are happening, each side of the wheel is spun twice, determining different terrain and incentives for each side. The results for each wheel can be found below:

### Terrain (roll a d6)

#### 1.Swamp

As you step out into the arena, the first thing that hits you is the smell. The stench of excrement, insect larvae, and stagnant water catches in the back of your throat. The air is thick with moisture and you can already feel sweat beading on your brow. Your foot hits wood and you notice that above the marshy floor of the arena sits a series of thin wooden catwalks, casting a loose grid over the map. The arena floor under the walkways is covered in thick mud and dotted with fetid pools of brackish water.

The marshy floor underneath the walkways is considered difficult terrain

A creature that starts or ends its turn in one of the pools around the arena must succeed on a DC13 CON save or take 2d6 Poison damage and become poisoned. The creature can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Once a creature has become poisoned in this way, they cannot be poisoned again for the length of the combat, but can still take the 2d6 Poison damage if they start or end their turn in one of the pools.

#### 2.Dungeon

You take a step out onto a cobblestone floor, splattered in dried blood, with moss creeping out from between the stones. You shiver, a damp cold hanging in the air around you. Some walls jut out of the floor, seemingly at random, across parts of the arena, but there are no roofs above and any corridors created are open at both ends.

Spike traps (5ft by 5ft squares dotted across the floor) = DC15 Investigation or Perception check to notice, DC13 DEX save or take 2d6 piercing damage and fall 10ft.

Tripwires (between walls 10ft apart, especially at bottlenecks) = DC15 Investigation or Perception check to notice, DC13 DEX save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from a battering ram emerging from the wall and smashing you against the opposite one.

If incentives 1, 2, or 3 are rolled, the incentive is located in a small room with walls on 3 sides and an open doorway that spans the width of the room. If incentive 4 is rolled, there is instead a pouch of 200GP in this room.

At the entrance to that room is a pressure plate (DC15 Investigation or Perception check [free action] to notice). If a character steps on the pressure plate, pikes will erupt from the floor in the doorway behind them, sealing the entrance to the room and preventing the creature’s exit.

On the wall behind the incentive are three lit torches. On a successful DC15 Investigation check (free action), the character knows which one to pull to open the door behind them and can take a bonus action to do so. On a failure, they can try at random, each attempt taking a bonus action (can use their action as well if they want to try twice in one turn). When they haven’t tried any of the torches, they succeed by rolling a 5-6 on a d6. If they’ve pulled one wrong torch, they succeed by rolling a 4-6 on a d6. When only 1 torch remains, they automatically pull the right one.

A creature inside has half cover from ranged attacks from outside, and vice versa. Any creature can choose a point through the pikes as the centre of a spell though.

#### 3.Desert

The ground is thick with soft sand and your feet sink just below the surface as you take your first step into the arena. Hot wind picks up some of the sand and the grit scratches across your face, making you squint slightly to protect your eyes. Tall sandstone pillars jut out from the sand vertically and diagonally, creating a broken latticework of safe ground across the arena.

Quicksand (10ft x 10ft circle on ground in middle of battlefield) = DC 13 STR save to exit. If you fail you get sucked deeper. 3 failures and you get sucked under. If you don’t struggle, you can remain in the sand but your movement is reduced to 0.

Every turn on initiative 20, roll a d4. On a 4, a sandstorm obscures the battlefield for the round. Creatures can spend a bonus action to shield their eyes from the sand, otherwise they are blinded until the storm ends.

All sand is difficult terrain. The pillars are far enough apart but requiring jumps between them (DC10 Acrobatics or Athletics check if they have sufficient long jump). One pillar stands vertically, 5ft away from the quicksand.

#### 4. Labyrinth

All you can see after you step out is polished stone. Walls rise up 10ft into the air forming one large maze of 5ft and 10ft wide corridors, complete with dead ends and false shortcuts.

One or more minotaurs (depending on the power and number of the combattants) are loose on the map and will attack any creature they come across. (DM can choose which direction the minotaur takes at each branch at random by rolling on a d6 (splitting possible directions among the numbers on the die e.g. at a T-intersection, 1-3 = left, 4-6 = right)

If incentives 1, 2, or 3 are rolled, the incentive is located in a small room with walls on 3 sides and an open doorway that spans the width of the room. If incentive 4 is rolled, there is instead a pouch of 100GP in this room.

At the entrance to that room is a pressure plate (DC15 Investigation or Perception check [free action] to notice). If a character steps on the pressure plate, pikes will erupt from the floor in the doorway behind them, sealing the entrance to the room and preventing the creature’s exit.

On the wall behind the incentive are three lit torches. On a successful DC15 Investigation or Perception check (free action), the character knows which one to pull to open the door behind them and can take a bonus action to do so. On a failure, they can try at random, each attempt taking a bonus action (can use their action as well if they want to try twice in one turn). When they haven’t tried any of the torches, they succeed by rolling a 5-6 on a d6. If they’ve pulled one wrong torch, they succeed by rolling a 4-6 on a d6. When only 1 torch remains, they automatically pull the right one.

A creature inside has half cover from ranged attacks from outside, and vice versa. Any creature can choose a point through the pikes as the centre of a spell though.

#### 5. Underwater

On the other side of the doorway is a perfect wall of bright blue water. No foam disturbs its surface, but tiny waves lap vertically. A thin layer of sand covers the bottom of the arena, with large chunks of brain coral protruding from the floor and two giant, dark purple sea urchins to each side of the whirlpool. In the centre, you see a large whirlpool draggin water down from the ceiling above. In the corners of the arena, you see smaller columns of water shooting upwards with great force. As you push your foot, then shin through the doorway, you feel the pull of gravity on your lower leg weaken as the warm water cradles it. Across the way, you see one of your enemies swig from a glass vial, then both dive horizontally into the water, kicking their legs and waving their arms to keep themselves in place, bubbles emitting from only one of their mouths.

Half the combattants (rounded down) on each side are given potions of water breathing. If the combat features a group of humanoid creatures against non-humanoids, half the humanoid combatants are given potions of water breathing and the other creatures get none.

If a creature succeeds on a shove action underwater, they can choose to push their target 10ft instead of 5ft, however the successful creature will also need to move 5ft in the opposite direction.

The lumps of brain coral on the ocean floor (5ft x 5ft) deal 1d6 slashing damage to any creature pushed into them.

The giant sea urchins are extremely dangerous. Any creature that touches them takes 1d6 piercing damage and any creature pushed into them takes 2d6 piercing damage. In either case, the creature must succeed on a DC13 CON saving throw or take an additional 1d6 poison damage and become poisoned.

Water spouts (5ft x 5ft) occupy each corner of the arena. A creature can voluntarily enter them to travel up to the ceiling only using 5ft of movement, but must succeed on a DC13 DEX saving throw to exit the spout without being crushed against the ceiling and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature which wishes to move through a water spout without being thrust upwards must succeed on a DC13 STR saving throw. Otherwise, they will be pushed to the ceiling and will have to take the DC13 DEX saving throw to avoid being crushed as above.

A large whirlpool (10ft x 10ft) sits at the centre of the arena. Any creature who voluntarily enters or is pushed into the whirlpool will be dragged to the bottom of the arena. To exit the whirlpool, a creature must succeed on a DC13 STR saving throw, or be grappled. The creature can repeat the DC13 STR saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns to escape the grapple. Any creature who wishes to cross the whirlpool without being dragged down must also succeed on a DC 13 STR save, or be sucked to the bottom of the arena and grappled by the whirlpool as above.

#### 6. Underdark

As the doorway clears in front of you, you find yourself squinting instinctively. The entire arena is covered in magical shadow, save for a few spots of bright orange, bioluminescent algae across the floor, and your nose is filled with the scent of damp and decay. The outlines of enormous toadstools, the size of trees, can be made out, thrusting up from the arena floor. One sits in the centre and two in opposite corners. Half-lit by nearby algae, you also make out some large, colourful mushrooms, blue, green, and yellow. Around each of them you see a haze of spores floating in the air, caught by the light from the algae like dust motes in a sunbeam.

Partial magical darkness meaning everything is in dim light (disadvantage on Perception checks and -5 to Passive Perception).

Big toadstools (10ft x 10ft) to hide behind or climb up to get the higher ground. One right in the middle of the arena and two in opposite corners.

3 types of large (5ft x 5ft) mushroom across the battlefield (2 of each). If you start your turn within 5ft of one of them you are subjected to the following effects:

Yellow = DC13 Wisdom saving throw or become afraid of all foes you can see. Lasts until you next take damage

Blue = DC13 Intelligence saving throw or you become stupefied and lose your turn, only taking your turn after you next take damage. This changes your place in the initiative order. If you do not take damage before your next turn, you lose your turn entirely.

Green = DC13 Charisma saving throw or have emotions calmed, such that you do not commit any act of violence until you next take damage. Can still heal your co-combattants, but don’t see your competition as enemies.

If you start your turn within 5ft of multiple mushrooms, you must roll to save against both of their effects.

### Incentives (roll a d4)

#### 1. Wealth

A bag containing 500GP is chained to the roof, starting 10ft in the air. It cannot be opened until the end of combat.

Every 6 seconds it rises an additional 5ft off the ground. Requires sufficient jump height, a free hand, and a DC 13 Athletics or Sleight of Hand check to get it off the chain (takes an action)

If a creature has the bag, it can stow it away using their bonus action. Another creature can use their action to attempt to take the bag from them, triggering a contested Athletics or Sleight of Hand check (each creature’s choice). If the bag is stowed, the creature attempting to take the bag rolls with disadvantage.

#### 2. Treasures

All valuables have been taken off the combatants (gold, magic items, etc). One valuable taken from each opposing team has been placed inside a large, magically locked puzzle box near the middle of the field.

Opening the box requires a DC 13 Arcana check, then a DC13 Sleight of Hand check, one after the other.

If a creature has already succeeded on the Arcana check, another can attempt the Sleight of Hand check, opening the box on a success.

If a creature fails on the Arcana check, they take 1d6 lightning damage. If they fail on the Sleight of Hand check, they take 1d6 poison damage.

The magical field surrounding the arena also casts the Identify spell for any creature that takes items from the box. Attunement is not required when the items are used within the arena, meaning a creature can use them immediately as long as they satisfy any race, class, and alignment requirements of the items. If a creature keeps a new item after the combat, they will need to attune to it to use it to its full capacity.

Whoever holds the items at the end of the combat keeps them. If nobody has any at the end, the items are returned to their owners.

The box also has an AC of 20, 20HP, and is resistant to all damage except bludgeoning by a magical weapon. If the box is reduced to 0HP, it is destroyed, along with the items within.

#### 3. Servants

There is a large (15ft x 15ft) cage in the middle of the battlefield. Its bars are made of obsidian with thin, dark purple rivulets cut into the stone. These veins pulse every 6 seconds, turning from the dark, almost-black purple, to a lighter shade of violet. On inspection, the horizontal cross-bars at the top of the cage are etched with a message in Infernal: “My nourishment is your gain”

If you are within 15ft of the cage, you can choose to use your action to burn a spell slot (of any level), a number of ki points, a number of bardic inspiration dice, or 10HP to be fed to the cage.

When the cage is fed, a number of imps appear inside, corresponding to how many of each resource have been contributed (e.g. if you burn a lvl 3 spell slot, 3 imps appear. If you burn 2 ki points, 2 imps appear. If you sacrifice 40HP, 4 imps appear etc.). The DM may re-balance or add to these resources based on the combattants involved.

If within 5ft of the cage, a creature can spend an action to attempt to break it open with a DC12 Arcana or Sleight of Hand check. The DC for this check increases by 1 for every imp contained within. Once the imps have been released, the cage closes again and spell slots can be given to it again.

The cage also has an AC of 20, 20HP, and is resistant to all damage except bludgeoning by a magical weapon. If subjected to the dispel magic spell, the cage will cease to work, all contained spell slots will be wasted, and all imps contained within will be returned to the Nine Hells.

The imps will be loyal to whoever released them, attacking their enemies. The imps do not have their Shapechanger ability, or the Invisibility action. All imps disappear at the end of the combat.

#### 4. King of the Pits

A volunteer audience member is transported from their seat to a crystal sphere above the middle of the arena and asked what they most want to see in the fight (roll on a d4, options listed below). They watch the battle and on initiative count 1 (losing ties), decide which individual combatant has best fulfilled their desire. That creature gains inspiration (advantage on one attack roll, saving throw, or skill check of their choice, decided before they roll) which expires at the end of combat. If one creature gains this inspiration more than once, they stack.

1. Blood (whoever deals the most damage during the round)

2. Magic (whoever casts the most levels worth of spells or uses the most special abilities [DM's discretion as to what counts as a special ability, e.g. extra attack probably doesn't count, bardic inspiration might])

3. Resilience (whoever takes the most damage during the round)

4. Perspicacity (whoever attempts to use environmental elements to their advantage most)
