## Start of session

> The three of you are standing in the destroyed master bedroom of the Mayor's Manor, having just killed the minotaur, Munvak. [[Jasper Bartlett]] and [[Conk]] are both unconscious, tied to chairs against the far wall, and Ven Leser's lifeless body is slumped in the corner, half lying under a writing desk. What are you doing?

> Jasper gives your group a bloody smile, and you see he is now missing several teeth. "That's twice now you've saved my hide. This is becoming a bit of a habit. I hope y'all fared better in town than I did."

> "They think the miner's found something, deep in the mine, but wouldn't say what. They heard it from the mayor's secretary, Heather."

> "I think we need to find Heather. See what she knows. I didn't see her with the group in the manor. Maybe she's down with Jim?"

> _Encounter_
>
> - Overview: Can the PCs successfully enter the Mayor's Manor?
> - Purpose: Get information from Heather about the mine, the Land Sharks
> - Choice:
> - Cast of Characters:
>   - Heather
> - Action: Parley, Avoid, Combat
> - Development:
>   - Feigns ignorance, doesn't know what the PCs are talking about
>   - If pressed, admits the butler, Percy, approached her and told her she'd be made a house member if she gave him information on the mayor
>   - "The miners found some glowing purple door"
>   - The map is probably in his desk somewhere, why?"
>   - Secretly an Emerald Claw - Tarkanen Assassin (Friends, Charm Person)
>   - Will attempt to charm the warforged


- This room is a utilitarian office. The mayor's dead body has not been moved and is still slumped over his desk, his face purple and splotchy from the poison. Simple bookshelves line the walls, filled with books about effective leadership and governance. A simple writing desk sits in the middle of the room, and a coat rack in the corner has a plain-looking cloak hanging from it, softly rustling.

- Desk has a false bottom drawer with the !"Ring Of Igga Strongrage" and the map of the #"Mine Of Whitecliff" in it
  - DC 12 Perception check if searching desk, DC 10 Investigation check if not

- Cloak is the !"Cloak of Billowing"

- Players will need to make periodic stealth checks and avoid wandering Bandits with wands of pyrotechnics

- The mine is only accessible via a elevator with a Ring of Air Elemental Command slotted into the key position OR convincing the air elemental in the elevator to help them

#### Entrance

> The mine sits a full days ride to the north west, in the foothills of the Endworld Mountains. The ride takes you past several of the stark white cliffs, though none are as large as the one near town. You see little wildlife, other than a large herd of goats climbing along the side of one of the cliffs, and as you get further from the town, the vegetation starts to die off, becoming patchy and brown.

> As night begins to fall, Jasper calls for a halt at a campsite at the base of a cliff. "Trust me, we don't wanna be caught out here at night. Nothin' good roams these hills past sundown."

- Use as camp as opportunity for role play
- who builds the fire? Does anyone cook something?
- dream sequences - <https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3555h3/campfire_questions_a_way_for_pcs_to_have_fun/>
- So, Bob, no idea who your pop was?

#### Parley

> Below you is the mining camp. The camp sits on a small hill that backs onto a sheer, bone-white cliff, where a large cave leads inside. A large palisade surrounds the camp but there only two permanent buildings, both next to the cave. You see 4 guards standing around the open gate in the middle of the wall. Large glow lamps illuminate some of the camp, especially in the middle, and you can see on the slopes of the hill inside the palisade are several tents. In the darkness between the tents, you make out the light of lanterns being carried. As you're looking, you hear a loud roar and the sound of something huge thrashing against metal.

> Jasper pulls out a spyglass and looks through the camp. "Hmm, a captured Bulette. That thing looks mighty angry."

#### Setback

#### Conflict

> **Encounter**
> _Tarkanen Assassin, Bandit Captain_

#### Reward

- The Claw leader is giving orders to bandit to "take the ring and head to the mine to prepare for the arrival of the Mistress of the Claw"

#### Notes

##### Entrance - Mine Lobby / Pond

> The elevator slows, then lurches to a stop. The doors retract and open onto a long room with reinforced walls. A door opens to the west at the far end of the room, and you see crates of raw mined Eberron dragon shards stacked along the wall. As you step off the elevator, you hear a loud BOOM echo from deep in the mine, and a few seconds later the room rumbles. One of the crates of dragonshards tips over with a crash and the room is filled with dust and the sound of falling pebbles from the ceiling.

> As you get closer to the door, you hear the sound of raucous laughter come from nearby, along with a muffled thud. The laughter subsides, then you hear a voice say:
>
> _"Did you see that creepy elf girl that came down with Quinn earlier?"_
>
> _"Yeah, she was terrifying. Plus, Scar said he saw the old bone piles movin around on the ground near her."_
>
> _"Hah, I weren't scared of her or the Emerald Claw. Just wanted to see if you were."_

> The door leads to a hall heading north, where you see minecart tracks. Directly across the hall is a large barracks chamber, and you can make out several people laying on the ground near a campfire, tied up and gagged. You hear more laughter from inside the room, and then you see another person, hands tied, stumble onto the fire, but they're able to thrash off of it before it seriously harms them.
>
> _"I'm bored. Go grab another miner so I can practice my knife throwing." _
>
> _"You do it. I ent your servant"_

---

> **Encounter**
> _2x Bandit_
> Bandits are lazing on the beds against the wall, tossing a dragon shard between them.

_**Pond**_

_Room_

> The natural cave opens into a small cavern dominated by a pond. The surface of the pond is rippling, waves emanating from near the middle of it, despite the dull, stale air in the room. Scattered around the pond are seven statues, and the ground around the statues is a deep rust. The rust color extends towards the pond out from the statues before disappearing under its surface. There are several sets of footprints in the cavern, but they look old, as if the miners disregarded this room quickly.

^92d830

_Statues_

> The statues are all goblins in various fighting poses arrayed in a circle. Each is holding an ornate sword hilt, but the blades are all missing. You notice that at the base of each statue is a small stone, carved into a hemisphere, with a hole carved through it.
> [[Vola’khesh]]

_Pond_

> As you get closer to the source of the waves, you step on something hard that snaps under your feet.
>
> Reaching down, your hand wraps around something smooth. It is too heavy to pull up out of the water with one hand.

> The waves suddenly stop, then something darts toward you in the water. You feel something small wrap around your hand, then it quickly moves up your arm and out of the water, onto your shoulder, and you see a small worm.
> [[Earworm]]

##### Parley - Mine Shafts

###### _Room_

> The mine shaft heads through an arched doorway ahead of you, carved into the shape of two goblins holding up a large crystal, unlike anything else you've seen in the mine so far. In the middle of the crystal is a glowing red number 1.

> As soon as you cross the threshold of the archway, a force field shimmers into existence and the number above the archway swirls into a zero.

###### _Dolgrim Room_

> You turn the corner and several large piles of bones pushed to each side of the tracks.

> As you move towards the room, you begin to hear a rattling noise coming from the bones.

> __Encounter__
> 4 Dolgrim burst from the piles of bones and attack the party

##### Setback - Spider Queen / Collapsed Bridge / River Crossing

_**Spider Queen**_

> A large sign sits at the entrance to the cavern, reading "BEWARE! DO NOT DISTURB THE SPIDER QUEEN!"

> As you head down the passage, spiderwebs begin to appear on the wall, and you can see large, dark shapes skittering around on the wall.

> The passage ahead of you is nearly entirely blocked with large spiderwebs, though some have been hacked away to allow passage, and the stench wafting out of the cave is almost unbearable. You can hear something large moving about inside, and periodically, a loud, keening wail.

> The cave is hard to move through, as the webbing keeps grabbing at you, forcing you to break through. As you disturb the webs, the sobbing stops, and then you hear someone say:
>
> "Have you come to end me as well, then?"

> A large, half woman/half spider creature lowers to the ground on a line of webbing. Jasper looks at you in shock and whispers, "A drider? How long has that thing been down here? We can't fight this creature."
>
> She looks you over for a few seconds. "You are not of the Emerald Claw. I do not smell the taint of the lady of death on you. Explain yourselves."

- Five bandits have been captured by the spider queen
- Can get through bridge collapse this way if they gain passage

_**Collapsed Bridge**_

> You hear the sound of rushing water from ahead of you and then the mineshaft opens into a large cavern. The tracks head out onto a sturdy looking bridge over a wide river below you, but it looks like the bridge has collapsed about halfway across. Someone is sitting on the other side of the bridge, and you can faintly hear them humming to themselves.

> As you get closer to the gap, you recognize that the man is the one you helped free from the Whitecliff jail.
>
> '"Oh ho, [[Pust]] knew if he waited long enough, he would see you again! Once again, [[Pust]] has been proven right!"

> "They have not used the coin yet. It is a pity. But they shall lead Pust to the shard, regardless!"

> The gap in the bridge is about 50 feet long, and the edges of the bridges are scorched.

- The drop is about 100 feet
- Anyone who falls in can swim along the river until it drops underground. Comes up in the Pond Cave

_**River Crossing**_

> You hear the sounds of fast flowing water from the cavern ahead of you, and the sounds of boats knocking against each other. The sound of laughter rises over the sound of the water, briefly, and then you hear a loud splash.

> You see three bandits, one a huge half-orc, pushing around several miners with their arms bound and burlap sacks tied around their heads. The half-orc is wearing black-dyed leather armor, and you can see three bright green slashes painted on the front of it that look like something huge scratched deep into him.
> _**If they dally**_: Suddenly the orc picks one up and chucks him into the water, where he is quickly dragged away by the swift current.

> _**Encounter**_
> _2x Bandit, Bandit Captain_

##### Conflict - Dhakaan Entryway

#### Entrance

> The natural cave ahead is lit by a dull purple glow. As you head deeper into the light, you see it is coming from a the very end of the cave, which ends suddenly into a sheer wall. On the floor at the base of the wall are three bodies.
>
> As you get closer to the wall, you see four dials set into the wall, about halfway up, and just below each of them is a push button. Four numbers materialize out of the air above the dials, glowing red.

[Wheel of Frustration](https://dd.joshtrate.com/#/wheel-of-frustration)

> The flickering lamplight from the lanterns in the mineshaft illuminates an ornately decorated room beyond the door, with several pillars carved along the wall, depicting noble goblins holding up the ceiling. In the middle of the room is a small dais, and next to it on the ground is some sort of display stand. A large plaque sits on the base of the dais. Several sets of footprints in the dust lead away from the opening to the right towards a grand double door to your left, standing open. The footprints look recent, having disturbed a large cloud of dust as they moved through the room that is just now beginning to settle.

> The plaque on the dais is written in an ancient text that you don't recognize.
> _If someone has the [[Earworm]]_: You're not sure what language is written on this plaque, but you can make out what it says: "Here lies the horn [[Ghaal'duur]], used to unite the Dhakaani"

#### Parley - Dhakaani Statues

> The room beyond the doors is almost pitch black, the light from the mineshaft not able to reach this far. The doors themselves have a beautiful, detailed carving on them, depicting a goblin holding a large red horn standing in front of six other goblins.

- The doors have a large carving of Jhazaal Dhakaan uniting the six goblin tribes with the red dragon horn
- Bob can recognize the ruins as Dhakaani with a DC 10 history check

> The light reveals a large cavern. The room you just came out of is a small . A huge statue of the same goblin on the door dominates the center of the cavern, and at the base of it are several life-sized statues of goblins standing behind slabs of a purplish metal. In front of the slabs are several skeletal bodies. A large paved path leads away from the statue in the direction they're facing, but the cavern has collapsed in that direction. In the rubble, you can see something metal glinting.

- Inspecting skeletons: DC 15 Perception to see they seem goblinoid but there are FAR too many arms

> The goblin statues are all holding weapons and have grim looks of determination on their faces. A hobgoblin has its arm raised, its mouth open in a scream, and in its hand is a some sort of long metal tube with a complex metal mechanism at the end, made out of the same purplish metal of the slabs. Scattered around the hobgoblin are several small spheres of the metal that look like ball-bearings.
> Item - [[Musket]]

> You clear away the rubble and find the body of a grotesque, deformed warforged. It doesn't have a head, but there appears to be one large eye, in the chest. Above the eye is a brilliant yellow gem ([[Delver's Light]]). Clearing more rubble away reveals a large snake-like tail instead of legs. It has two arms, but neither ends in a fist; one arm ends in a stump with a [[Wand Sheath]] above it, while the other has a long sword directly embedded into it. [[Armblade]]

> The paved road leads away from the statue towards a small building, beyond which you can see a set of steps rising to a temple above.

#### Setback - Trapped Corridor

Potential Traps:

> This room is little more than a long hallway, but in this room is the first sign of life you've seen since entering the ruins. The stench of a body fills the room, which you can see lying against the wall a little less than halfway to the other side. The rest of the room is unremarkable stone.

> The body is crumpled and broken, but you can see three bright green slashes in the front of his black leather armor, similar to what you saw on the one of the people back at camp.
> _**Perception Check**_: DC 13 to notice a perfect square devoid of dust on the ground
> _**Perception Check**_: DC 17 to hear the faint sound of someone screaming from above

#### Conflict

> The hall opens up into another large cavern, with steps carved into a slope up towards a beautiful temple. The air in here smells ancient, as if it has been undisturbed for millennia, and a dark red light is flickering inside the temple, almost like the glow of a dark bonfire. As you get closer you realize the flickering is the shadows from something moving around in front of the light. The red light becomes more and more intense as you head up the stairs towards the light, but now that you're close to the doors you can see a number 0 glowing faintly above the door and a shimmering forcefield is present, blocking the way forward. Suddenly the light flashes a bright red and you hear a voice cry out in pain. Jasper looks at you in surprise and says, "I think that's Quinn!"

> Looking through the force field, you see a large dragon shard sitting on a dias in the middle of the temple, pulsing a deep blood red. Quinn lies on the ground in the fetal position in front of the dais, and you can hear faint whimpers of pain, and standing over him is an elven girl, who is intensely inspecting the dragon shard. The rest of the temple looks intact, with large carved pillars rising up to the ceiling, their paint faded to dull, drab colors, and there is the scent of something rotting coming from inside the temple but you can't see any dead bodies.

> Long, skeletal wings unfurl from the girls back as she turns to face you. She slowly begins walking towards you and as she gets closer, you realize she is undead - half her face is just a skull and her wings are little more than bone. She has elven features but her remaining skin is scaled, not smooth, and it glitters in the dark red light. A large, partial dragonmark, one none of you have ever seen but clearly a Siberys mark, is visible on the side of her face still covered with skin, but it was ripped in half with her face. She walks around each of you, inspecting you.
>
> _"This is who the Chamber sent to stop me? Two forged ones, a changeling, and a washed up human? After all these years...the disrespect."_

> Mim, she stares at you with her one remaining eye, her other a dark void in her skull. "I'll need to have a little chat with Kel. I told him to rein your kind in."

> Jeremiah:  "I feel the mark of the flame upon you. It ripped you in half, didn't it?"

> Bob: "You...you are different from the others. I can feel the mark of your maker upon you. I respected him, until the end. He gave you a great gift, child. But oh, how you squander it."

> Jasper: "Ah, and you are the one the prophecy speaks of. Your life will be given in service of forces far greater than you, mortal." _**Suddenly she slams her hand against the force field and you see her straining, pushing against it harder and harder, until her hand bursts through, grabbing Jasper. She quickly pulls him towards the force field and he smashes into it, letting out a gutteral scream as he begins to slide through.**_

> She throws Jaspers unmoving form over her shoulder and walks back to the dragon shard.
>
> "Quinn, get rid of these Chamber spies and return to me in Sharn. We must find the rest of the Shards of Khyber."

> **Encounter**
> _Fight with Quinn_
> Paragon - Bandit Captain / Bloody Bones @half HP with Dolgrim backup if necessary

_**After the Battle**_

> Jeremiah, you slam your longsword into the side of Quinn and see the life leave his eyes. As you pull the sword free, you're suddenly seeing double, and you feel an intense regret that you could not save this man, that his heart was too far gone, and then your shield flares to life, shining a cool, blueish-silver light on the cavern, and you see a vision:  You see a human man, who you recognize, somehow, as yourself, at the top of a large, tiered city in front of an ornate cathedral, fighting against a terrifying, fiendish looking tiger standing upright. Your human body is wreathed in a silvery flame, the same color as the light coming from your shield, and you can also see your two companions and, surprisingly, a young, elven girl, with scaled skin and wings, fighting more of the creatures as people flee the cathedral, and then your vision snaps back, your shield dims, and your back in the dark cavern.
