### Parley
> The servant opens the door to the guesthouse, and you step into a utilitarian common room. A wooden table large enough to sit eight people sits to your left, along with a small pantry, and on the right are several sitting chairs arrayed around an unlit stone fireplace. In the middle of the room is a large chest made out of a gray wood. Three doors in the back are open and through each you see a simple bed against the wall. The servant enters the room, still limping slightly, and then stands to one side. He says: 
> [!quote] Yoss
> I have been instructed by my master to see to your needs. The full clanhold is at your disposal.
> 
> The chest is yours, templar. We have held it for hundreds of years, awaiting the return of the Flame to reclaim it.

> [!treasure]
> The chest is rather large but plainly designed, made out of a dark grey wood that you, Mim, recognize as Xen'Drik'n floatwood used by some Lhazaar pirates for shipbuilding. Two leather latches secure it. The chest looks brand new, despite its apparent age, and the lid is feather light even though it looks sturdidly built.
> 
> The chest is full of old, old Galifar gold coins, still depicting the first king of Khorvaire. Resting on top of the coins is a longsword made out of the same floatwood as the chest, lacquered and polished until its surface shines. Half buried underneath the gold is a pair of silver-armored leather gauntlets, palms glowing with a soft blue sigil.
[[Longsword of Verdict]]
[[Gauntlets of Deliverance]]

### Setback - Attempted Kidnapping of [[Bob]]

> [!info]
> While the three of you take in the house, Bob, where would you like to go?

> [!info]
> 
> Bob, as you move through the village, Lizardfolk are swinging through the trees all around you. Most of the platforms you can see are teeming with groups of them going about their day, and you begin to see signs of the different clans - you see a group all wearing bright golden feathers, another who have all painted their faces red. While you're walking around, you hear a loud horn blare three times from towards the center of the village, and a good portion of the lizardfolk on the platform begin heading towards it.
> 
> 
> Give me a perception check.
> `dice: 1d20 + 7` -> Stealth Roll 1
> 
> > [!success]-
> > As the lizardfolk move, you catch a glimpse of a lizardfolk with ashy-grey skin clawhook his way into the treetop above you, but you don't see him afterwards. You suddenly realize that he's been following you for, as you have caught glimpses of him a few times.
> 
> > [!fail]-
> > You can't see anything in the mass of lizardfolk leaving the platform.
> 

**SWITCH TO OTHER GROUP**

### Conflict - [[Krot]] the Destroyer, Chief of the Gray Ash

> [!question]
> What are the rest of you doing in the house?
> 

> [!info]
> 
> While you ==BLANK==, you hear three loud horn blasts emanate from deeper into the city. Yoss turns towards Jeremiah and says, 
> 
> > [!quote]
> > **Sir Flame**, the tribal council will begin soon. Your presence is required. Your servants may join as they wish. Please, follow me to the Council Circle.
> 
> Yoss turns and beckons you outside the house.
> 

> [!info]
> 
> Yoss leads you out over a rope bridge towards the middle of the city. Looking around, you see a large number of lizardfolk are heading this direction, mostly swinging through the branches using clawhooks.
> 

**SWITCH TO BOB**

> [!info]
> Bob, the lizardfolk around you are heading towards the center of the village. 
> 
> > [!success]- If Succeeded Above
> > You cannot see the lizardman that has been following you - it seems like he is still in the treetops above you. 
> 
> What are you doing?

> [!info]
> > [!success]- If Succeeded Above
> > 
> > As you ==do that==, you finally spot the lizardman between the leaves, peering down out you through the branches. 
> 
> 
> 

#### Circle of Elders

> [!info]
> 
> The tree you are heading towards is massive, at least a hundred feet wide, and it seems that all of the rope bridges leads towards it. There is no platform - instead, the rope bridges lead into the tree itself, which has been hollowed out.
> 
> The inside of the tree-structure has been turned into a giant ampitheater. The rope bridge exits onto a circular walkway, and tiered benches lead down to a platform with twelve seats, facing each other.
> 
> > [!info]- Enter Immediately
> > Lizardfolk are streaming in on all sides, heading down into the seating area. [[Yoss]] gestures to you to follow him to a set of stairs off to the side that spiral down underneath the benches where you meet up with Drox. 
> 
> > [!info]- Go After Bob
> > You see [[Drox]] standing in the middle of the twelve seats, eleven of which are filled with the other Cold Sun clan chiefs, and his magically-amplified voice is booming through the ampitheater as you walk in.
> > 
> > > [!quote] Drox
> > > The Lords of Dust have begun to make their moves. The Blackscale's attempts at awakening [[Haka'Torvhak]] are growing more frequent and bolder. The time has come to attack!
> > 
> 

> [!important]
> 
> - [ ] Mention that [[Rosamund Yirr]] has been seeing oddities from the Boneyard
> - [ ] Krot questions Jeremiah's intentions, reveals Bob had a Coin of Dust
> 

> [!quote] Drox
> Krot, do not dismiss this so lightly! The Lords of Dust are showing themselves again! We cannot allow this! 

> [!quote] Krot
> Clearly they are showing themselves again! Drox, Ã©You brought one into our midsts!

> [!quote] Drox
> Jeremiah, sir Flame, please tell them! This threat, it cannot be allowed to grow! The voice of the flame entrusted us to keep [[Haka'Torvhak]] silent.

### Conflict - The Blackscales Attack

[REFERENCE THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6acd7t/guide_to_the_jungle/)

> The lizardman chieftain, [[Drox]], leads you east away from the riverbank and through the thick undergrowth. As you move away from the river the undergrowth begins grows sparse, and very little light reaches down to the jungle floor here.

> [!quote]
> The clanhold lies about half a day east. Please, before we begin, have some refreshment. 

> He holds out a waterskin and pulls out a large golden fruit that you've never seen before and offers it, saying:

> [!quote]
> A single bite of the [[Sun Cedar Fruit|fruit of the Sun Cedar]] will heal your wounds. It is not often we offer this to outsiders.  

> The fruit is slightly sweet and juicy, and as you eat it you feel your body healing itself. After just a few moments, you also feel completely refreshed -- as if you've just had a peaceful long rest.
>
> He continues to lead you deeper into the forest. It's hard to see much around you between the gloom and the dense trees, but [[Drox]] seems to be able to see a winding trail in the leaves on the ground. You hear animals moving about in the trees above you, but can't see anything but the distant canopy when you look.

> After another mile or so, [[Drox]] calls for a halt in a small clearing defined by several fallen trees. He gestures at you, [[Jeremiah Pumpernickle|Jeremiah]], and says:

> [!quote]
> The Crazy Fist clan are truly honored to have an esteemed Templar in our midst. We would have you speak at the Council, so that we may learn of the Flame's intentions.

> As the two of you are speaking, suddenly from the jungle you hear a _TWANG_ and a bright green arrow buries itself into the tree next to Drox. Drox swears, then hurriedly jumps behind one of the fallen trees and calls for you to hide. **ROLL INITIATIVE**

> A lizardman much taller than those you've seen so far drops out of the treetops, landing at the far edge of the clearing from you. His scales are pitch black, his eyes glowing a dark yellow in the gloom of the forest floor. Dozens of bones hang from his clothing, clattering wildly as he moves, and he pulls out a [[Xibalban Blade|jagged black longsword that trails a faint red mist]].

> [!info]
> Finally, you begin to hear the sounds of civilization ahead of you. The game trail you've been following widens, and then in the distance you see several glowing orbs illuminating a town built up amongst the trees. The trail leads to the base of a large tree that has a wide set of stairs attached to it heading up into the clanhold.

> [!info]
> The stairs go up into the understory to a large platform built around the tree. Several rope bridges branch out from the platform, heading off into the town. Hundreds of lizardfolk are moving through the air, some on the rope bridges, some swinging on claw hooks. [[Drox]] gestures out towards the town and says, "The Crazy Fist clanhold welcomes you, templar."
> 
> A young lizardfolk dressed in a pure white robe walks up to your group and bows to [[Drox]]. Drox says:
> 
> !!! ad-quote
> 	The council will be held tomorrow night to decide if the Cold Sun go to war. Jeremiah Silver Flame, I ask that you speak on what you know of the evil in this jungle.
> 	
> 	I have some clan business I must attend as the other tribes arrive. Please allow this servant to see to your needs. It will take you to the guesthouse.

> And then he bows to each of you and takes his leave.

- SERVANT NAME: **YOSS**

> The servant [[Yoss]] bows to you and turns, walking to a nearby rope bridge. He stops and turns around to face you, waiting patiently for you to go with him.

### Parley
#### Notes

> The servant heads out over the rope bridge, moving swiftly and sure-footed.

> The bridge lets you off onto another large platform, this one with several buildings built into the tree trunk it surrounds. A circle of lizardfolk stands on this one, jeering at something in the middle. The servant begins to lead you around the circle when suddenly a lizardfolk crashes out of it, colliding with [[Yoss]] and throwing both of them to the ground. The circle of lizardfolk is open now, and in the center of it stands a lizardfolk with ashy grey scales, laughing, then he says: 
``` ad-quote 
Brothers! Witness! The Crazy Fist have grown weak! And look, their pet templar! Why has the Silver Flame returned now? They abandoned us to our fate! TELL US, TEMPLAR! WHY ARE YOU HERE!
```

> The lizardman thrown out of the ring weakly stands, and you recognize him as the one [[Drox]] sent to gather the other clans - [[Jax]]. His arm hangs useless at his side and blood is streaming from cuts all over his body. "It seems the Gray Ash clan do not think much of your order, Jeremiah. Step lightly here."
