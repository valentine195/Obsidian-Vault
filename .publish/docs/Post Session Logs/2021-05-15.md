The session begins with the four of you walking through the dense undergrowth of the Q'barran jungle with Drox, chieftain of the Crazy Fist Cold Sun. After a bit he calls for a halt and offers you each a bite of the secret Sun Cedar fruit, which makes you feel as if you've just had a long rest.

He led you further east into the gloomy, dark jungle. After another mile or so of hiking along a game trail, he called for a halt in a small clearing and began chatting with the four of you, specifically telling Jeremiah how honored he was that a Templar would visit them after all these centuries. He asked if Jeremiah would speak on their behalf at the tribal council, which Jeremiah agreed to.

As the four of you were attacking, an arrow shot out at Drox, slamming into a tree near him. He quickly took cover and told the four of you to do the same as a large, jet-black lizardman dropped down to the forest floor with a wicked looking black obsidian sword that trailed a fine red mist as it moved through the air. This new lizardman told Drox that he was being lied to; one of his new companions was a Dust Lord.

Jeremiah killed the blackscale just before it was able to escape, and the rest of you cleaned up the remaining lizardmen except for one that Bob saw swing away in the trees. Drox confronted the four of you about being a member of the Lords of Dust, and it was discovered that Bob's coin was a Coin of Dust - allowing the Lords to track the group. Drox took it and said the coin was the trapped soul of an evil Raksasha, which Jeremiah realized was the evil tiger-looking creature from his vision. Drox said the shamans of his tribe would be able to cleanse the coin.

You continued through the jungle and eventually made it to the Crazy Fist clanhold, where hundreds of lizardfolk were swinging through the treetops between buildings and platforms built in the canopy. He lead you up the stairs to the first landing and took his leave of you, saying he had clan business to attend to, but a servant would see to your needs. Bob peaced out, looking for a shop, but finding the lizardfolk prices much to exorbitant for his tastes. The rest of you were being led through the platforms along rope bridges, but before you could make it to the guest house a large Cold Sun lizardfolk challenged Jeremiah about what he was actually doing here, since the Silver Flame had abandoned them years ago. Jeremiah was able to talk him down, and you were told that he was a member of the Grey Ash clan, who hate the Silver Flame.
