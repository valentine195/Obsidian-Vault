## Session 2

The group started in the jail. Mim took some fancy weighted dice, but noticed that Jasper was staring at her. He confronted her for being a changeling, but the situation was defused when Conk barged into the room, sword waving, trying to save the group.

Conk explained that the town was under siege by the bandits, and they had rounded up several townspeople and taken them to the manor. Several other townspeople were barricaded into the Pub. Jasper told the group to save the people in the pub while he scouted out the manor.

They snuck to the Pub and confronted the bandits in front, successfully saving the townsfolk inside. Jeremiah's shield flared with light when he killed a bandit that was about to kill a townsperson. The owner of the pub, Jim, said that a bunch of people were taken to the manor.

The group went to the manor and successfully snuck in, then saved the townspeople on the first floor. They went upstairs and found the room of Luca Strongrage, where Mim found the stuffed rabbit, Bun-Bun. They then listened at the door to the master and heard Percy, Ven Leser's butler, tell someone to move their plans up at the mine because Quinn's plan had failed. They entered the room to find Conk and Jasper tied to chairs in the middle of the room, Percy standing at a window, and Ven Leser tied up upstairs.

The group attacked and Percy quickly fled. They untied Ven Leser and fought the minotaur, but Bob and Mim went down and Ven Leser died before they were able to kill the minotaur.
