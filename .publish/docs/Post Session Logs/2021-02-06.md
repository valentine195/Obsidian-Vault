The group long rested and nursed Jasper and Conk back to health. Jasper told them that he heard Percy talking about hearing information from Heather, the mayor's assistant. They went looking for her and found her in the Mayor's office, rifling through the bookcases, muttering "I know it's here somewhere."

Jeremiah confronted her and she said she was just trying to help Percy out because he said she'd be admitted into the house, she never wanted to kill the mayor. Jeremiah destroyed the desk to intimidate her, which exposed a drawer with a hidden desk. Then Heather cast charm person on Mim and Jeremiah while Bob was outside with Ghouly, but when he realized something odd was going on he went inside and grabbed the drawer before Heather could get it. She swung her sword at him in anger, and then Mim countered the charm with Bun-Bun. They eventually killed her, but not before she kept saying that the Lady of Death was going to kill them all anyway and her death was just a release back to the Lady.

After finding the map in the drawer, they spent their day about town. Jeremiah and Mim won some gold playing dice while Bob spent the day making a potion of health. An airship landed in town with a reporter from the Newthrone Gazette, who wanted to interview who he was calling the "Heroes of Whitecliff".

The next day, Conk returned with a miner, who told them the Land Sharks had overrun the mine. They traveled to the mine as quickly as they could, but had to make camp. Mim learned that Jasper knows the leader of the Gray Tide, a changeling named Kel. Bob learned that his workshop appeared outside of town the day of the Mourning, and looks exactly like other Cannith architecture Jasper has seen. Jeremiah learned his shield is from a Templar of the Silver Flame.

They made it to the mine, where Mim released a captured Bulette which caused havoc in the camp. The rest of the group snuck in and made it to the elevator of the cave, where they defeated a bandit captain to gain possession of the ring of air elemental command, then entered the elevator and began to descend to the mine.
