The elevator lurched to a stop at the Heroes of Whitecliff stepped into the mine. While they were taking in their surroundings, a loud ka-BOOM echoed through the mine, shaking the room they were in. Investigating further into the mine, they found a small barracks filled with bound miners, and they could hear two bandits talking about some creepy elf girl that came down to the mine with Quinn. After freeing the miners, the group told them to barricade themselves inside the room. The miners offered to let them rest there if they ever required it.

The group continued through the mine. They found a room with several goblin statues, where they found small stones that allowed them to telepathically communicate with each other. Mim investigated the lake, and an earworm shot out of it and quickly wormed inside her ear, giving her the ability to read and speak Goblin. Going further into the mine, they found a shaft that had some sort of forcefield on it, preventing more than one person being inside it at a time. They also found a room with several four-armed goblin skeletons that attacked them. Eventually they came to a bridge across a rushing river far below, but the bridge had been destroyed-probably the source of the explosion earlier.

On the other side of the bridge sat Pust, the man that was in the jail of Whitecliff that freed them. He cryptically said that he knew they would lead him to the Shard, and that his master would be pleased - but he could not reveal who his master was. He then threw himself down into the river below. The group was able to get across the gap in the bridge thanks to Ghoulie (and Jeremiah executed a sick Tarzan swing).

On the other side of the bridge, they came to a large cavern being guarded by two Emerald Claw. After dispatching them, they hid the bodies in the stalagmites and found a large, glowing purple locked door. Opening it revealed an ancient ruin. They found another group of goblinoid statues, one of which was holding the metal remains of a Musket. Jeremiah also found a grotesque, snake-like warforged that had several odd items embedded in it. Continuing on, they eventually came to a temple that had a glowing red light coming from it but was protected by a forcefield. Inside was Quinn with a young elven girl.

Mim tapped on the forcefield with her musket and the girl turned around to inspect them. She looked young, but had large, skeletal wings, her skin was scaled like a dragon, and half her face was nothing but skull. A giant dragonmark covered the other half of her face, but it was clearly incomplete.

She looked over the group and said, "So, after all this time, this is who the Chamber sends to stop me?" then went for a closer look.

She knew Mim was a changeling, and muttered that she would need to have Kel rein in his underlings.

She told Jeremiah she felt the touch of the Silver Flame upon him, and that it had ripped his soul in half.

She told Bob that she knew his father, and respected him, so it was a pity that he had to die in such a way.

Then she saw Jasper, and said, "This must be the aberrant the prophecy spoke of," then she shot her hand through the force field, grabbed Jasper, and ripped him through. He fell unconscious and she put him over her shoulder, then grabbed the shard and teleported away before telling Quinn, "Meet me in Sharn when you take care of the witnesses."
