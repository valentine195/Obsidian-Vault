Agathax led the group into the guest house and the group discussed recent events. Agathax revealed the history of the Overlords and the dragons, as well as who Tira Moran was when Jeremiah revealEd he was not actually a Templar.

As they were speaking the ground began to rumble, slowly getting stronger until they heard a massive boom. Agathax turned to the volcano in time to see it explode once again, sending the top skyward in a massive plume of ash and lava. Out of the volcano flew Rhashaak, heading straight for the clan tree.

Agathax told the group to flee. Mim asked if she could have her bodyguard's cloak since they expected to die, and he laughed and threw it to her. The group fled quickly but as they were running to the boats Jeremiah was tackled by Krot, the grey scale. The group fought the Lizardfolk off and made it to their boat. Pust, the weird shadow dude, was waiting there for them.
