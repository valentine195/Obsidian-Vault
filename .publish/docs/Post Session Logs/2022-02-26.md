Mim expertly navigated the boat down river, eventually bringing the group to Newthrone - but not before Bob became addicted to gambling. Airships swarmed through the skies above the city, but one airship in particular was familiar to the group as the House Tharashk airship they burned down.

After much debate about how to disguise themselves from the bounty hunters, and decided to just keep their hoods up. Mim docked the boat and paid a dockhand to drive the boat back upriver. Bob was entranced by the tourist traps, and Merigold nearly killed a man over a grain aof rice.

Eventually they began making their way to the Gray Tide hideout that Mim remembered from her past travels. On the way, they ran into a group of children who **immediately** recognized them as the Heroes of Whitecliff. They hounded them with questions, and talked about how Everest was going to kill them and send something called an Inquisitor after them. Continuing on, they found a newsboy selling the latest issue of the Newthrone Gazette, which they purchased and read.

They made it to the Hideout, finding Lars. He told them the only way they were getting on an airship was sneaking on one, stealing one, or getting a job - and he knew the Newthrone Gazette was hiring. Believing the Gazette would be flying to Sharn soon to cover the Race of the Eight Winds, they headed out. On the way, Bob checked in on the stone they planted in Everest's cloak, where he saw one of the children that was asking them questions tell him they were in town.
