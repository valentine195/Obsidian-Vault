The Heroes started in the Dhakaani temple. They saw Quinn's body melt away into nothingness, then long rested. While resting, Bob and Mim had a heart to heart about Mim's disregard for life, and then the group decided to rescue Jasper from Sharn. They backtracked through the mine and when they met the miners at the entrance, they told them that they saw the same thing - the bandits bodies just melted away into nothingness.

They reached town without incident, but when they got there the Heroes saw a large, expensive-looking airship, emblazoned with the logo of House Tharashk and the name _Hunter of the Skies_. They met Jim's wife, Sheila, at the edge of town, and she told them that a Tharashk bounty hunter had come looking for them, thinking they killed his nephew and an heir to House Tharashk, Ven Leser.

Mim went inside and dramatically billowed her cloak. Inside the pub, she saw Jim and the bounty hunter, Everest, at a table in the back. Ven Leser's butler, Percy, stood behind him, and whispered in Everest's ear as soon as he saw Mim.

Mim tried to convince Everest that Percy was the one that betrayed and killed Ven Leser, but Everest didn't believe her, and he eventually revealed (through his magic scrying ring) that he figured the group would be reluctant to come with him, so his group went ahead and captured Conk. He told her to come back to the pub at dawn, or they would be putting Conk on trial for the murder - and he would probably be executed.

Meanwhile, outside the pub, Jeremiah and Bob were talking to one of the bugbear guards about his whittling.

While debating whether or not they could steal the airship, or if it was worth going with Everest to the Shadow Marches to be closer to Sharn, Jim told them it would be easier to go to Newthrone and book passage to Sharn on an airship there. He told them if they rescued Conk, they could use his boat to get away in the middle of the night.

The group quickly came up with a plan - Jeremiah would be a distraction using the wand of pyrotechnics while Bob and Mim snuck on board the airship and rescued Conk from the bridge. They crept up to the ship and saw two guards posted at the base of the elemental ring, but before they could execute their plan, Merigold and Dinodas killed the guards and said, "I'm back, bitches!"

Merigold, Mim and Bob climbed up onto deck and Jeremiah then tried to cause the distraction, but the wand malfunctioned and started spewing fireworks everywhere. The sailors on board scrambled out of the galley in the chaos, thinking they were under attack. Everest started turning the ship to shoot the source of the fireworks with the cannons while Mim snuck down to the brig to save Conk. Bob snuck into the captains quarters and put one of the Volaâ€™khesh stones into Everest's coat, so they could listen to his thoughts, then trained his parrot to say he was never there to avoid suspicion. Merigold crept up behind Everest and attacked him, causing him to lurch in pain, making him angle the ship down towards the ground.

Mim and Conk was pinned behind barrels in the cargo hold by the sudden lurching, and she asked Bob to come help her. After being rescued, she pulled out a torch and lit the cargo hold on fire. Merigold righted the wheel and jumped down on deck as Bob, Mim and Conk came up out of the hold. Jeremiah threw the wand away and returned to the ship to climb up it to help them, but as he was climbing, he saw everyone on the ship jump overboard. Mim, Conk and Merigold landed safely, but Bob crashed into the ground too hard and went unconscious. Jeremiah jumped down off the ship in a super hero pose, grabbed Bob's body, and the group fled the ship. They dropped Conk off at the pub, went to the pier, and cast off from Whitecliff as the Tharashk airship burned in the night sky behind them.
