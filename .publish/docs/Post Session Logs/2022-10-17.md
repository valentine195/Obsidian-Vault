The group had begun heading towards the Newthrone Gazette, hoping to convince Harvey to give them a ride to Sharn. On the way, they heard a little orphan boy yelling that a bounty had been placed on the Heroes of 10,000 gold. Suddenly, Mim noticed that he sped off. 

Mim remembered a tavern that she used to frequent that everyone loved: Raymond’s Respite. They made their way there and saw a beautiful man peering in the window. Inside was dimly lit with few patrons. The group got a table in the back and were discussing next steps when the door suddenly slammed open and four of the beautiful people walked in.

The bartender identified them as Rierdrans and was quick to level a crossbow at the newcomers but they froze him in place with hardly an effort. The Rierdrans walked up to a Kalashtar man who was sitting at the bar ignoring them; they began provoking the Kalashtar and Jeremiah rose to defend him.

A chaotic, wacky battle ensued that resulted in a Shifter man realizing he needs to get his life back together, an orc being murdered by Mim’s dagger, and two of the Rierdrans fleeing.
