Jeremiah opened his eyes to see himself on top of a massive stepped pyramid overlooking a vast city. A large templar was squatting in front of him, fully armored in gleaming silver platemail, and behind them was a large bonfire blazing in front of an ornate citadel. They questioned Jeremiah's pureness after he slaughtered a defenseless lizardfolk, and then gave him a grave warning:

> **"The dust lord Durastoran has set his plans in motion. The lady of death is the key. Find the seekers of the Draconic Prophecy - your group was unforeseen and can work outside the bounds of fate."**

And then she threw Jeremiah into the flame.

Meanwhile, Merigold and Bob were running from a large group of greyscaled lizardfolk back to their guesthouse. Bob felt Jeremiah's body grow warm as he carried him, and then Jeremiah jerked awake, his skin turning a dull silver. By the time they got back, Dinodas had eaten the the clan leader's body, Drox.

Mim started to go towards Agathax the witch but realized she did not know where to go and was disoriented due to the incoming storm. Yoss the servant ran up to her and was asking her what happened back there, and when she mentioned she was trying to find Agathax, he said he'd lead her there. After a particularly perilous bridge crossing due to the wind, he gave her a clawhook to use just in case. After reaching the platform just before the witch house, suddenly the lanterns on the platform all flew off, casting the platform into pitch blackness. A massive, looming shape appeared in a flash of lightning, and suddenly attacked Yoss, nearly killing him, before Mim yelled out that they were friends - and then she saw the shimmering cloak of Agathax's bodyguard.

Jeremiah barricaded the door into the guesthouse as Merigold and Bob tried to figure out what to do. Merigold looked out towards the volcano in time to see it explode in a shower of lava and a massive dragon flew up out of it. Shortly after a blackscaled lizardfolk dropped onto the balcony and attacked. Bob made some bombs for Merigold and Jeremiah to use, and some greyscaled lizardfolk were able to squeeze through the door. Merigold killed the blackscale by hitting some blast powder that Bob slipped into his back pocket, and the greyscaled lizardfolk fled.

Agathax was floating in mid air inside the witch house, wrapped in a soft purple light. She mentally spoke to Mim, who asked her about what the templar told Jeremiah. She said that the lizard clans had maintained contact with the Seekers of the Draconic Prophecy, but she did not know where they were - other than that they had an enclave in Sharn.
