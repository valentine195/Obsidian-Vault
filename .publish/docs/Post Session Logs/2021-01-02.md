The PCs met Ven Leser D'Tharashk, who had hired them to escort a wagonload of dragon shards through the hills to Newthrone. They, along with Conk the goblin, left town with Quinn, the wagon driver. On the road they met Jasper Bartlett, who asked Quinn why he was working with the very people they used to fight.

The trip was uneventful on the first day, where they were able to just get to know each other. But on the second day, Quinn pulled off the side of the road and met with a half orc and two humans, who informed the group that they were robbing them of the dragon shards in an insurance scam. They told the group that if they helped them unload the cargo then no one would need to get hurt, so the group (very untrustfully) followed them to the cave.

Once in the cave, the group helped unload the dragon shards into a bag of holding, but were betrayed once the shards were all loaded. They successfully subdued the attackers, and Nia executed the last remaining bandit who was begging for mercy. Jasper Bartlett brought Quinn back into the cave, and Jeremiah found a fancy light up shield engraved with a silver flame. Jasper told the group he wanted to talk to the mayor to run Tharashk out of town.

They headed back and began speaking to the mayor, but the mayor was poisoned by a cup of coffee. Ven Leser burst into the room and accused the group of murdering the mayor. He had several of his guards arrest the group, but before they were able to subdue them, Mim (as Nia), was able to escape out the window, invisible. In jail, they met a man named Pust, who gave them a large golden coin in exchange for freeing him. She followed them up to the jail cell and changed into a guard, and was able to successfully convince the other guards that she was sent to help -- while they were distracted with cards, she picked the locks of the cells. Pust shadow stepped away from the jail, and then the group successfully killed the guards and reclaimed their weapons.
