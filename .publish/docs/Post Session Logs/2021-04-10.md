- mim: we could send a letter with the ring saying he's still alive or forge Ven Leser's handwriting
- _**BARDS IN NEWTHRONE**_

The adventurers were floating down the river away from Whitecliff, watching the Tharashk airship burn in the night sky. Eventually, they entered the jungle, and the oppressive heat began to make Merigold and Mim feel miserable.

Before settling in for the night, Mim brought up some ideas for getting House Tharashk off their tail - either faking being Ven Leser and sending the House his signet ring, or spreading a tale through the bards of Newthrone.

After about a day of travelling, Mim started to get bored and dozed off at the wheel, sending the boat into a group of vines, which attacked! They wrapped around the boat and started trying to pull it apart. One of the vines grabbed GHOULY and flung him overboard before the group was able to cut themselves free.

They continued their trek downriver, but the river was blocked by several dead brontosauruses floating across it. Several lizardfolk were on the debris, trying to clear it away. The group dropped anchor, Bob created a cold zone for Mim and Merigold to rest at, and Jeremiah and Bob rowed out to meet with the lizards. Drox, Chieftain of the Crazy Fist clan of the Cold Sun lizardfolk, spoke with them, and told Jeremiah how honored they were to have an Ember of the Silver Flame again after all these centuries of no contact, but that they still held up their end of keeping the demons in the Q'Barran jungle at bay.

While they were speaking, drumbeats began emanating from deep inside the jungle, and a rhythmic chanting rose, getting louder and louder, before cutting out suddenly with a bestial roaring. The chieftain explained that the blackscales were attempting to summon one of the ancient demons, and he sent a lizardfolk out to gather the clans for a tribal council, and offered the group shelter while the river was cleared.
