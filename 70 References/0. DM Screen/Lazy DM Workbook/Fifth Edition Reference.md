# 5e Reference

The following five pages include reference material specifically designed for fifth edition fantasy roleplaying. This page provides a summary of those materials.

## Skills and Abilities

This reference summarizes fifth edition skills and their associated abilities. Use this table to remember what skills can come into play in the game when calling for an ability check. Remember that skills can be associated with other abilities if it makes sense for the situation.

## Typical Difficulty Classes

This table provides a rough gauge of various ability check and saving throw DCs, presenting the perceived difficulty of each. These guidelines allow you to assign DCs based on relative challenge, and are independent of character level.

## Improvised Statistics

Use this table to quickly generate statistics for traps, hazards, challenges, fantastic features, physical objects, and any other features that can deal or take damage. The level noted on the table doesn’t necessarily correlate to the level of the player characters. Rather, it represents the level of the challenge. If 3rd-level characters wander into a 7th level dungeon, then traps featuring statistics from the Level 5–7 row of the table are what they should face.

These statistics are not intended to represent monsters, even if you have the need or desire to improvise monsters at the table. Instead, consider re-skinning an existing monster (see chapter 15 of Return of the Lazy DM).

## Actions in Combat

This section lists the various actions that characters and monsters can take in combat.

## Cover, Light, and Visibility

These references summarize how cover, light, and visibility work in fifth edition.

## Minimum Targets in Areas of Effect

When you’re running combat either on an abstract map or in the theater of the mind, it helps to have a rough estimate of how many creatures might fit into an area. You can use this breakdown as a baseline for different areas of effect, then increase or decrease the number of creatures that might be affected based on the situation, the size and number of those creatures, and their positions.

## What Breaks Concentration

This section provides references to the different situations that can break concentration for spellcasters and other characters.

## Conditions

This section contains descriptions of the various fifth edition conditions and status effects.

## Exhaustion

This section describes the various levels of exhaustion.

## Quick Encounter Building

This reference is intended to help you quickly gauge the relative difficulty of a combat encounter for a specific group of characters. Use this information to compare the level of the characters, the challenge rating of the monsters, and the ratio of the number of monsters to the number of characters.

These guidelines are built around creating a hard encounter, but they’re not guaranteed to produce a balanced encounter. (In fact, there’s no such thing.) Rather, their primary purpose is to help you see whether an encounter might push from being hard to being deadly, so that you can give the players fair warning.

## Running Large Numbers of Monsters

The stories and situations in your game have no limits, so that it’s possible for a group of characters to face three dozen orcs, or a hundred skeletons, or even larger groups of foes. But when you’re running more than a dozen monsters, rolling for every attack or saving throw can slow down the game to the point of making it unmanageable.

This section helps you adjudicate how many monsters will hit a target creature or succeed on a saving throw, given the difference between the attack score or DC of the attacker and the AC or saving throw of the defender. Also discussed in this section is the option to pool together the hit points of a large number of monsters, so that the characters can gain maximum effect from the damage they deal to those monsters individually.

These approaches to running large numbers of monsters require a bit of work to understand them. It’s worth testing these rules before you try to use them during your game.

## Madness

Often underused, the rules for short-term and long-term madness can add flavorful status effects when characters interact with objects, beings, or energy from realms beyond the limits of the mortal mind. These effects are often imposed when a character fails a Charisma saving throw, with a DC based on the nature of the source of the madness.
