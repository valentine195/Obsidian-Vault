### Jumping, Climbing, Swimming, Etc

**LONG JUMP**

Jump distance in feet is equal to STR with a 10 foot run-up, distance is halved from standing.

**HIGH JUMP**

Jump height in feet is 3 + STR with a 10 foot run-up, height is halved from standing.

Max reach equals jump height plus 1 1/2 character height.

**CLIMBING / SWIMMING / CRAWLING**

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DMâ€™s options difficult surfaces or currents may require a succesful STR (Athletics) check.
