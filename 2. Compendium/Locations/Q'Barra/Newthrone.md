### Info

from reddit
> [!info:]
> King Sebastes ir’Kesslan is receiving military support from [[Riedra]]. The region around Newthrone features Harmonious Shield garrisons aiming to defend the settlers from lizardfolk attacks, but they are also spreading Riedran values. The Inspired view Q'barra as a strong foothold in Khorvaire. Their relationship with Newthrone provides them with a source of Eberron dragonshards and a base for their troops. The Dreaming Dark could engineer further conflict with lizardfolk, Lhazaar pirates or Valenar raiders to encourage the King to request more troops.
> 
> A group called the [[Finders of the Lost]] work to recover cultural artifacts of old Galifar and are officially sanctioned by Newthrone. The king's rule is unstable with the various players in town all having designs on the place. His sister and first minister Alzia ir'Kesslan works to uncover plots and identifty threats.
> 
> **==Newthrone is also courting the larger halfling tribes, seeking alliance for trade/mutual defence based on their joined disinterest in the Five Nations.==**
> 
> One of the Cold Sun Tribes of lizardfolk, the Twilight Walkers, is willing to work with settlers as ambassadors between tribes/settlers. They often visit Newthrone.
